11 in the name of allah the merciful the most merciful
12 praise be to allah lord of the worlds
13 the merciful the most merciful
14 owner of the day of recompense
15 you alone we worship and you alone we rely for help
16 guide us to the straight path
17 the path of those upon whom you have favored not those upon whom is the anger nor the astray amen please answer
21 aliflaammeem
22 that is the holy book where there is no doubt it is a guidance for the cautious of evil and hell
23 who believe in the unseen and establish the daily prayer who spend out of what we have provided them
24 who believe in that which has been sent down to you prophet muhammad and what has been sent down before you to prophets jesus and moses and firmly believe in the everlasting life
25 these are guided by their lord these surely are the prosperous
26 those who disbelieve whether you forewarn them or not they will not believe
27 allah has set a seal upon their hearts and ears their sight is dimmed and for them is a great punishment
28 there are some people who say we believe in allah and the last dayyet they are not believers
29 they seek to deceive allah and those who believe but they deceive none except themselves though they do not sense it
210 there is a sickness in their hearts which allah has increased for them there is a painful punishment because they lie
211 when it is said to them do not corrupt in the land they reply we are only reformers
212 but it is they who are the evildoers though they do not sense it
213 when it is said to them believe as other people believe they reply are we to believe as fools believe it is they who are the fools if only they knew
214 when they meet those who believe they say we too believe but when they are alone with their devils they say to them we follow none but you we were only mocking
215 allah will mock at them and prolong them in sin blundering blindly
216 such are those who barter away guidance for error their trade did not profit them nor are they guided
217 their example is like one who kindled a fire and when it lit all around him allah took away their light and left them in darkness they could not see
218 deaf dumb and blind they shall never return
219 or like those who under a cloudburst from the sky with darkness thunder and lightning they thrust their fingers in their ears at the sound of every thunderclap for fear of death and allah encompasses the unbelievers
220 the lightning almost snatches away their sight whenever it flashes upon them they walk on but as soon as it darkens they stand still indeed if allah willed he could take away their sight and hearing allah has power over all things
221 o people worship your lord who has created you and those who have gone before you so that you will be cautious
222 who has made the earth a bed for you and the sky a dome and has sent down water from the sky to bring forth fruits for your provision do not knowingly set up rivals to allah
223 if you are in doubt of what we have sent down to our worshiper prophet muhammad produce a chapter comparable to it call upon your helpers other than allah to assist you if you are true
224 but if you fail as you are sure to fail then guard yourselves against the fire whose fuel is people and stones prepared for the unbelievers
225 bear glad tidings to those who believe and do good works they shall live in gardens underneath which rivers flow whenever they are given fruit as provision they will say this is what we were given before for they shall be given in resemblance therein they shall have pure spouses and shall live there for ever
226 allah is not shy to strike a parable whatsoever a gnat or larger those who believe know that it is the truth from their lord as for those who disbelieve they ask what could allah mean by this parable by it allah misleads many and guides many but he misleads none except the evildoers
227 who break the covenant of allah after accepting it and sever what allah has bidden to be joined and corrupt in the land these are the losers
228 how can you disbelieve allah did he not give you life when you were dead and he will cause you to die and then restore you to life then you will return to him
229 he created for you all that is in the earth then he willed to the heaven and leveled them seven heavens he has knowledge of all things
230 when your lord said to the angels i am placing on the earth a caliph they replied will you put there who corrupts and sheds blood when we exalt your praises and sanctify you he said i know what you do not know
231 he taught adam father of humans the names all of them and then presented them to the angels saying tell me the names of these if you are truthful
232 exaltations to you they replied we have no knowledge except that which you have taught us you are indeed the knowing the wise
233 then he said to adam tell them their names and when adam had named them he said did i not tell you that i know the unseen of the heavens and earth and all that you reveal and all that you hide
234 and when we said to the angels prostrate to me yourselves towards adam they all prostrated themselves except iblis satan father of the jinn who in his pride refused and became an unbeliever
235 to adam we said dwell with your wife in paradise and both eat of it as much as you wish and wherever you will but neither of you should come close to this tree or else you shall both become transgressors
236 but satan made them slip therefrom and caused them to depart from that in which they had been go down we said be enemies to each other the earth will provide your dwelling place an enjoyment for a while
237 then adam received words from his lord and his lord relented towards him he is the receiver of repentance the merciful
238 go down all together we said so if a guidance shall come to you from me whosoever follows my guidance no fear shall be on them neither shall they be saddened
239 but those who disbelieve and belie our verses shall be the companions of the fire and there they shall live for ever
240 children of israel remember my favor i have bestowed upon you fulfill my covenant and i will fulfill your covenant with you me you must fear
241 and believe in what i have sent down confirming what is with you and do not be the first to disbelieve it do not sell my verses for a little price and fear me
242 do not confound truth with falsehood nor knowingly hide the truth while you know
243 establish your prayers pay the obligatory charity and bow with those who bow
244 would you order righteousness on others and forget it yourselves yet you recite the book have you no sense
245 and seek help in patience and prayer for it is heavy except to the humble
246 who reckon that they will meet their lord and that to him they will return
247 children of israel remember the favors i have bestowed on you and that i have preferred you the prophets among you above the worlds
248 guard yourselves against the day when no soul can avail a thing to another when neither intercession nor ransom shall be accepted from it nor will they be helped
249 remember how we saved you from pharaohs people who had oppressed you cruelly slaying your sons and sparing your women surely that was a great trial from your lord
250 we parted the sea for you and taking you to safety drowned the family of pharaoh before your eyes
251 we appointed for moses forty nights but in his absence you took the calf thereby committing harm
252 yet after that we pardoned you so that you might give thanks
253 and when we gave moses the book and the criterion so that you might be guided
254 and when moses said to his nation my nation you have harmed yourselves by taking the calf to worship so turn in repentance to your creator and slay yourselves that will be best for you with your creator and he shall accept you he is the receiver of repentance the merciful
255 and when you said to moses we will not believe in you until we see allah openly a thunderbolt struck you whilst you were looking
256 then we raised you from your death so that you might give thanks
257 we caused the clouds to cast their shadow over you and sent down for you manna and quails saying eat of the good things we have provided you indeed they did not harm us but they harmed themselves
258 enter this village we said and eat wherever you will and as much as you wish make your way prostrating through the gates saying unburdening we shall forgive you your sins and we will increase the gooddoers
259 but the harmdoers tampered with our words different from that said to them and we let loose on the harmdoers a scourge from heaven as a punishment for their debauchery
260 remember when moses prayed for water for his nation we said to him strike the rock with your staff thereupon twelve springs gushed from it and each tribe knew their drinking place eat and drink of that which allah has provided and do not act evilly in the land corrupting
261 moses you said we will no longer be patient with one type of food call on your lord to bring forth for us some of the produce of the earth green herbs and cucumbers corn lentils and onions what he answered would you exchange that which is lesser for what is better go down into egypt there you shall find all that you have asked humiliation and abasement were pitched upon them and they incurred the anger of allah because they disbelieved his signs and slew his prophets unjustly because they disobeyed and were transgressors
262 those who believe jews nazarenes and sabaeans whoever believes in allah and the last day and does good deeds shall be rewarded by their lord they have nothing to fear nor are they saddened
263 and when we made a covenant with you and raised the mount above you saying take what we have given you forcefully and remember what is in it so that you will be cautious
264 yet after that you turned away but for the grace of allah and his mercy you would have surely been among the losers
265 you have surely known of those amongst you who transgressed the sabbath we said to them be apes despised
266 we made it a punishment for the former times and for the latter an exhortation to the cautious
267 when moses said to his nation allah commands you to slaughter a cow they replied are you taking us in mockery i seek protection with allah lest i should be one of the ignorant he said
268 call on your lord they said to make known to us what she shall be he said he says she is a cow neither old nor virgin middling between both therefore do as you have been ordered
269 call on your lord they said to make known to us what her color shall be your lord says the cow is yellow a rich yellow pleasing to the onlookers
270 call on your lord they said to make known to us which cow she shall be to us cows look alike if allah wills we shall be guided
271 he replied he says she is a cow neither worn out plowing the earth nor watering the field one kept secure free from any blemish now you have brought us the truth they answered and they slaughtered her after they had been reluctant to do so
272 and when you slew a soul and then fell out with one another concerning it allah made known what you concealed
273 we said strike him with a piece of it like this allah restores the dead to life and shows you his signs in order that you will understand
274 yet after that your hearts became as hard as rock or even harder indeed among the stones are those from which rivers burst and others split so that water issues from them and others crash down through fear of allah allah is not inattentive of what you do
275 do you then hope that they will believe in you when some of them have already heard the word of allah and knowingly tampered with it after they understood it
276 when they meet those who believe they say we are believers but when alone they say to their other chiefs do you tell to them what allah has revealed to you so that they will dispute with you concerning it with your lord have you no sense
277 do they not know that allah has knowledge of all they hide and all that they reveal
278 and some of them are common people and do not know the book but only wishful thoughts and they are only doubters
279 woe to those who write the book with their own hands and then say this is from allah in order to gain a small price for it so woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for their earnings
280 they say the fire will never touch us except for a number of days say did allah make you such a promise for allah never breaks his promise or do you say about allah what you do not know
281 indeed he who earns evil and becomes engrossed in his sin they are the people of the fire in it they shall remain for ever
282 but those who believe and do good works are the people of paradise for ever they shall live in it
283 remember when we made a covenant with the children of israel you shall worship none except allah show kindness to your parents to kinsmen to the orphans and to the needy and speak of goodness to people establish your prayers and pay the obligatory charity but except for a few you all turned your backs and gave no heed
284 and when we made a covenant with you that you shall not shed your blood or turn yourselves out of your dwellings to this you consented and bore witness
285 yet there you are slaying your ownselves and turning a number of them out of their dwellings and helping each other against them with sin and aggression although should they come to you as captives you would ransom them surely their expulsion was unlawful do you then believe in a part of the book and disbelieve another what shall be the recompense of those of you who do that but degradation in the worldly life and on the day of resurrection to be returned to the most terrible punishment allah is not inattentive of what you do
286 such are they who buy the worldly life at the price of the everlasting life their punishment shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped
287 to moses we gave the book and after him we sent other messengers we gave prophet jesus the son of mary veritable signs and supported him with the spirit of purity gabriel will you then become proud whenever any messenger comes to you with that which does not suit your fancies and you belied some prophet jesus and killed others
288 they say our hearts are covered but allah has cursed them for their disbelief little is that they believe
289 and when a book came to them from allah confirming what was with them while before that they used to pray for victory over the unbelievers when there came to them what they knew they disbelieved him therefore the curse of allah be upon the unbelievers
290 evil is that for which they have bartered away their souls that they disbelieve what allah has sent down grudging that allah should send down from his bounty to whom he chooses from his worshipers they have incurred wrath over wrath for the unbelievers there is a humiliating punishment
291 when it is said to them believe in what allah has sent down they reply we believe in what was sent down to us but they disbelieve in what is sent after it although it is the truth confirming their own book say why before did you kill the prophets of allah if you are believers
292 moses came to you with clear signs then you took to yourselves the calf after him and you were harmdoers
293 when we made a covenant with you and raised the mount above you saying take what we have given you forcefully and hear they replied we hear but disobey for their disbelief they were made to drink the calf into their very hearts say evil is your belief that orders you to worship the calf if you are indeed believers
294 say if the abode of the everlasting life is with allah for you especially to the exclusion of all other people then long for death if you are truthful
295 but they will never long for it death because of what their hands forwarded and allah knows the harmdoers
296 indeed you will find them more eager than other people for this life and more than those who disbelieve each one of them wishes to live a thousand years but his prolonged life will surely not remove him from the punishment allah is the seer of what they do
297 say whoever is an enemy of gabriel indeed he has brought it down by the permission of allah to your heart confirming what was before it and a guidance and glad tidings to the believers
298 whoever is an enemy of allah his angels his messengers gabriel and michael indeed allah is the enemy of the unbelievers
299 we have sent down to you clear verses none will disbelieve them except the evildoers
2100 why whenever they make a promise do some of them cast it aside most of them do not believe
2101 and now that a messenger has come to them from allah confirming what was with them some of those to whom the book was given reject the book of allah behind their backs as though they knew nothing
2102 and follow what the devils recited over the kingdom of solomon solomon did not disbelieve it is the devils who disbelieved teaching people magic and that which was sent down upon the angels harut and marut in babylon they did not teach anyone until both had said we have been sent as a trial do not disbelieve from them they learned how they might separate a husband and his wife however they did not harm anyone with it except by the permission of allah indeed they learned what harms them and does not profit them yet they knew that anyone who buys it would have no share in the everlasting life evil is that for which they have sold their souls if they but knew
2103 had they believed and were cautious far better for them would be the reward from allah if they but knew
2104 believers do not say observe us raina in hebrew means evil  but instead say look after us undhurna and listen for the unbelievers is a painful punishment
2105 the unbelievers among the people of the book jews and nazarenes and the idolaters resent that any good should have been sent down to you from your lord but allah chooses whom he will for his mercy and allah is of great bounty
2106 if we supersede any verse or cause it to be forgotten we bring a better one or one similar do you not know that allah has power over all things
2107 do you not know that it is to allah that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belong and that there is none other than him to protect or help you
2108 would you rather demand of your messenger that which was once demanded of moses he who exchanges belief for disbelief has surely strayed from the right path
2109 many of the people of the book wish they might turn you back as unbelievers after you have believed in envy of their souls after the truth has been clarified to them so pardon and forgive until allah brings his command allah is powerful over everything
2110 establish your prayers and pay the obligatory charity whatever good you shall forward for your soul you shall find it with allah he is the seer of what you do
2111 they say none but jews and nazarenes shall be admitted to paradise such are their wishful fancies say bring us your proof if what you say is true
2112 indeed whoever submits his face to allah and does good works shall be rewarded by his lord there they shall have nothing to fear nor shall they be saddened
2113 the jews say the nazarenes are not on anything and the nazarenes say it is the jews who are not on anything yet they both read the book and those who do not know say like their saying allah will judge between them their disputes on the day of resurrection
2114 who does greater harm than he who prevents his name to be remembered in the mosques of allah and strives to destroy them those they will not enter them except in fear and for them shame in this world and a great punishment in the next
2115 to allah belong the east and the west whichever way you turn there is the face of allah he is the embracer the knower
2116 they say allah has taken to himself a son exaltations to him allah for him is what is in the heavens and the earth all are obedient to him
2117 creator of the heavens and the earth when he decrees a thing he only says be and it is
2118 and those who do not know say why does not allah speak to us or a sign come to us likewise those who were before them said similar to their saying their hearts are alike indeed we have clarified the signs to a nation who are certain
2119 we have sent you prophet muhammad forth with the truth a giver of glad tidings and a giver of warning you shall not be questioned about the companions of hell
2120 you will please neither the jews nor the nazarenes unless you follow their creed say the guidance of allah is the guidance and if after all the knowledge you have been given you yield to their desires you shall not have other than allah either a guide or a helper
2121 those to whom we have given the book and who recite it as it ought to be read truly believe in it those who disbelieve it shall be the losers
2122 children of israel remember my favor which i bestowed upon you and that i preferred your prophets among you above the worlds
2123 and fear a day when no soul for another will compensate a thing and no equivalent will be accepted from it neither intercession will benefit it nor shall they be helped
2124 and when abraham was tested by his lord with certain words and he fulfilled them he said i have appointed you as a leader for the nation abraham asked and of my descendants my covenant said he the harmdoers shall not receive it
2125 and when we made the house kabah a visitation and a sanctuary for the people saying make the place where abraham stood a place of prayer and we made a covenant with abraham and ishmael purify my house for those who circumambulate around it and those who cleave to it to those who bow and prostrate
2126 and when abraham said my lord make this country safe and provide its inhabitants whosoever of them believes in allah and the last day with fruits he said and whosoever disbelieves to him i shall give enjoyment for a while then i shall compel him to the punishment of the fire how evil an arrival
2127 and when abraham and ishmael raised the foundations of the house supplicating o our lord accept this from us you are the hearer the knower
2128 our lord make us both submissive to you and of our descendants a submissive nation to you show us our rites and accept us you are the receiver of repentance the merciful
2129 our lord send among them a messenger from them who shall recite to them your verses and teach them the book and wisdom and purify them you are the mighty the wise
2130 and who has no desire for the religion of abraham except he who fooled himself we chose him in this world and in the everlasting world he shall be among the righteous
2131 when his lord said to him submit he answered i have submitted to the lord of the worlds
2132 abraham charged his children with this and so did jacob saying my sons allah has chosen for you the religion do not die except being submissive muslims
2133 or were you witnesses when death came to jacob he said to his children what will you worship after me they replied we will worship your god and the god of your forefathers abraham ishmael and isaac the one god to him we are submissive
2134 that was a nation that has passed away theirs is what they earned and yours what you have earned you shall not be questioned about what they did
2135 they say be jews or nazarenes and you shall be guided say no rather the creed of abraham the upright one he was not among the idolaters
2136 say we believe in allah and that which is sent down to us and in what was sent down to abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the tribes to moses and jesus and the prophets from their lord we do not differentiate between any of them and to him we are submissive muslims
2137 if they believe as you have believed they shall be guided if they reject it they shall surely be in clear dissension allah will suffice you he is the hearer the knower
2138 the indelible marking of allah and who marks better than allah and for him we are worshipers
2139 say would you dispute with us about allah who is our lord and your lord our deeds belong to us and your deeds belong to you we are sincere to him
2140 or do you say that abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the tribes were jews or nazarenes say who knows better you or allah who is more unjust than he who hides a testimony received from allah and allah is not inattentive of what you do
2141 that nation has passed away theirs is what they earned and yours what you have earned you shall not be questioned about what they did
2142 the fools among the people will say what has made them turn away from the direction they were facing say the east and the west belong to allah he guides whom he will to the straight path
2143 and so we have made you a median nation in order that you will be a witness above the people and that the messenger be a witness above you we did not change the direction that you were facing except that we might know who followed the messenger from him who turned on both his heels though it was a hardship except for those whom allah has guided but allah would never waste your faith indeed allah is gentle with people the most merciful
2144 we have seen you turning your face towards the heaven we shall surely turn you to a direction that shall satisfy you so turn your face towards the sacred mosque built by abraham wherever you are turn your faces to it those to whom the book was given know this to be the truth from their lord allah is not inattentive of what they do
2145 but even if you brought those to whom the book had been given every proof they would not accept your direction nor would you accept theirs nor would any of them accept the direction of the other if after all the knowledge you have been given you yield to their desires then you will surely be among the harmdoers
2146 those to whom we gave the book know him prophet muhammad as they know their own sons but a party of them conceal the truth while they know
2147 the truth comes from your lord so do not be among the doubters
2148 and for everyone is a direction for which he turns so race in goodness and wherever you are allah will bring you all together he has power over all things
2149 from wherever you emerge turn your face towards the sacred mosque this is surely the truth from your lord allah is never inattentive of what you do
2150 from wherever you emerge turn your face towards the sacred mosque and wherever you are face towards it so that the people will have no argument against you except the harmdoers among them do not fear them fear me so that i will perfect my favor to you and that you will be guided
2151 as we have sent among you a messenger prophet muhammad from yourselves to recite to you our verses and to purify you who will teach you the book and wisdom and teach you that of which you have no knowledge
2152 so remember me i will remember you give thanks to me and do not be ungrateful towards me
2153 believers seek assistance in patience and prayer allah is with those who are patient
2154 do not say that those killed in the way of allah are dead they are alive although you are unaware
2155 we shall test you with something of fear and hunger and decrease of goods life and fruits give glad tidings to the patient
2156 who in adversity say we belong to allah and to him we shall return
2157 on those will be prayers and mercy from their lord those are guided
2158 safah and marwah are the waymarks of allah whoever performs the pilgrimage to the house or the visit there shall be no guilt on him to circumambulate between both of them and whoever volunteers good allah is thankful the knower
2159 those who hide the clear verses and the guidance we have sent down after we have clarified them in the book for the people shall be cursed by allah and cursed by the cursers
2160 except those who repent and mend their deeds and clarify those i shall accept them i am the receiver of repentance the most merciful
2161 but those who disbelieve and die disbelieving shall incur the curse of allah the angels and all people
2162 they are there in the fire for eternity neither shall the punishment be lightened for them nor shall they be given respite
2163 your god is one god there is no god except he he is the merciful the most merciful
2164 in the creation of the heavens and the earth in the alternation of night and day in the ships that sail upon the sea with what is beneficial to the people in the water which allah sends down from the sky and with which he revives the earth after its death and he spread in it from each moving creation in the movement of the winds and in the clouds that are compelled between heaven and earth surely these are signs for people who understand
2165 and among the people are those who take to themselves rivals other than allah loving them as allah is loved but those who believe are more loving to allah when the harmdoers see when they see the punishment because the power altogether belongs to allah and that allah is firm in punishment
2166 when those who were followed disown those who followed and they see the punishment and relationships are broken off
2167 those who followed them will say if only that we might return once and disown them as they have disowned us as such allah will show them their own works to be regrets for them and they shall never emerge from the fire
2168 people eat of what is lawful and good on the earth and do not walk in satans footsteps because he is for you a clear enemy
2169 he orders you to commit evil and indecency and to assert about allah what you do not know
2170 when it is said to them follow what allah has sent down they reply we will follow that which we found our fathers upon even though their fathers did not understand anything and they were not guided
2171 the likeness of those who disbelieve is as the likeness of he who calls to that which does not hear except a shout and a voice deaf dumb and blind they do not understand
2172 believers eat of the good with which we have provided you and give thanks to allah if you really worship him
2173 he has forbidden you the dead blood and the flesh of swine also that which is invoked to other than allah but whoever is constrained to eat any of these not intending to sin or transgress incurs no guilt allah is forgiving and the most merciful
2174 those who conceal what allah has sent down of the book and sell it for a small price shall swallow nothing but fire into their bellies on the day of resurrection allah will neither speak to them nor purify them theirs shall be a painful punishment
2175 such are those who buy error for guidance and punishment for pardon how patiently they will be in the fire
2176 that is because allah has sent down the book with the truth those who disagree about it are in extreme dissension
2177 righteousness is not whether you face towards the east or the west but righteousness is to believe in allah and the last day in the angels and the book and the prophets and to give wealth however cherished to kinsmen to the orphans to the needy to the destitute traveler and to the beggars and to ransom the slave who establish their prayers and pay the obligatory charity who are true to their promise when they have promised who are patient in misfortune and hardship and during the time of courage such are the truthful such are the cautious
2178 believers retaliation is decreed for you concerning the killed a free man for a free man a slave for a slave and a female for a female he who is pardoned by his brother let the ensuing be with kindness and let the payment be with generosity this is an alleviation from your lord and mercy he who transgresses thereafter shall have a painful punishment
2179 o owners of minds for you in retaliation is life in order that you be cautious
2180 written for any of you when death arrives if he leaves behind goods is the will for his parents and relatives with kindness this is a duty incumbent on the cautious
2181 then if anyone changes it after hearing it the sin shall rest upon those who change it allah is hearing and knowing
2182 he who fears injustice or sin on the part of a testator and brings about a settlement among the parties incurs no guilt allah is the forgiver and the most merciful
2183 believers fasting is decreed for you as it was decreed for those before you perchance you will be cautious
2184 fast a certain number of days but if any one of you is ill or on a journey let him fast a similar number of days later on and for those who are unable tofast there is a ransom the feeding of a needy person whosoever volunteers good it is good for him but to fast is better for you if you but knew
2185 the month of ramadan is the month in which the koran was sent down a guidance for people and clear verses of guidance and the criterion therefore whoever of you witnesses the month let him fast but he who is ill or on a journey shall fast a similar number of days later on allah wants ease for you and does not want hardship for you and that you fulfill the number of days and exalt allah who has guided you in order that you be thankful
2186 when my worshipers ask you about me i am near i answer the supplication of the suppliant when he calls to me therefore let them respond to me and let them believe in me in order that they will be righteous
2187 permitted to you on the night of the fast is the approach to your wives they are raiments for you as you are raiments for them allah knows that you have been deceiving yourselves he has accepted and pardoned you therefore you may now touch them and seek what allah has ordained for you eat and drink until the white thread becomes clear to you from a black thread at the dawn then resume the fast till nightfall and do not touch them while you cleave to the mosques these are the bounds of allah do not come near them as such he makes known his verses to people so that they will be cautious
2188 do not consume your wealth between you in falsehood neither propose it to judges in order that you sinfully consume a portion of the peoples wealth while you know
2189 they question you about the crescents say they are times fixed for people and for the pilgrimage righteousness does not consist in entering dwellings from the back but righteousness is he who wardsoff sin enter dwellings by their doors and fear allah so that you will prosper
2190 fight in the way of allah those who fight against you but do not aggress allah does not love the aggressors
2191 kill them wherever you find them drive them out of the places from which they drove you dissension is greater than killing but do not fight them by the holy mosque unless they attack you there if they fight you kill them like this is the recompense of the unbelievers
2192 but if they desist know that allah is the forgiver and the most merciful
2193 fight against them until there is no dissension and the religion is for allah but if they desist there shall be no aggression except against the harmdoers

2199 then surge on from where the people surge and ask allah for forgiveness he is forgiving and the most merciful
2200 and when you have fulfilled your sacred duties remember allah as you remember your forefathers or with deeper reverence there are some who say lord give us good in this world he shall have no share in the everlasting life
2201 but there are others who say lord give us a merit in the world and good in the everlasting life and save us from the punishment of the fire
2202 these shall have a share of what they have earned swift is the reckoning of allah
2203 remember allah during counted days whosoever hastens on in two days no sin shall be on him and if any delay no sin shall be on him for he who wardsoff evil and fear allah and know that you shall be assembled unto him

2211 ask the children of israel how many clear signs we have given them whoever changes the favor of allah after it has come to him allah is firm in inflicting the punishment
2212 for those who disbelieve the worldly life is decked with all manner of decorations they scoff at those who believe but the cautious shall be above them on the day of resurrection allah gives without count to whom he will
2213 the people were one nation then allah sent forth prophets to give them glad tidings and to warn them and with them he sent down the book with the truth that he might rule between the people in that which they differ only those to whom it had been given differed about it after the clear verses had come to them transgressing between themselves then allah guided those who believed concerning that which they were at variance in the truth by his permission allah guides whom he will to the straight path
2214 or did you suppose that you would go to paradise untouched by that endured by those before you affliction and adversity befell them and they were shaken until the messenger and those who believed with him said when will the victory of allah come is it not so that the victory of allah is near
2215 they will question you about what they should spend in charity say whatever good you spend is for your parents kinsmen orphans the needy and the destitute traveler allah is aware of whatever good you do
2216 offensive fighting is obligatory for you though it is hateful to you but you may hate a thing although it is good for you and may love a thing although it is evil for you allah knows and you do not
2217 they ask you about the sacred month and fighting in it say to fight in this month is a grave offense but to bar others from the path of allah and disbelief in him and the holy mosque and to expel its inhabitants from it is greater with allah dissension is greater than killing they will not cease to fight against you until they force you to renounce your religion if they are able but whosoever of you recants from his religion and dies an unbeliever their works shall be annulled in this world and in the everlasting life and those shall be the companions of hell and there they shall live for ever
2218 but those who believe and those who migrate and struggle in the way of allah those have hope of the mercy of allah allah is forgiving and merciful
2219 they ask you about intoxicating drink and gambling say there is great sin in both although they have some benefit for people but their sin is far greater than their benefit they ask you what they should spend say that which remains so allah makes plain to you his verses in order that you will reflect
2220 upon this world and the everlasting life they will question you concerning orphans say doing good for them is best if you mix their affairs with yours remember they are your brothers allah knows the corrupter from the reformer if allah willed he could have brought hardship upon you he is almighty and wise
2221 do not wed idolatresses until they believe a believing slavegirl is better than a free idolatress even if she pleases you and do not wed idolaters until they believe a believing slave is better than a free idolater even though he pleases you those call to the fire but allah calls to paradise and pardon by his permission he makes plain his verses to the people in order that they will remember
2222 they ask you about menstruation say it is an injury stay away from women during their menstrual periods and do not approach them until they are cleansed when they have cleansed themselves then come to them from where allah has commanded you allah loves those who turn to him in repentance and he loves those who cleanse themselves
2223 women are your planting place for children come then to your planting place as you please and forward good deeds for your souls and fear allah and know that you shall meet him give glad tidings to the believers
2224 do not make allah a deterrent through your oaths that you be righteous cautious and reform between people surely allah is hearing and knowing
2225 allah will not call you to account for a slip in your oaths but he will take you to task for that which is intended in your hearts allah is forgiving and merciful
2226 for those who swear a wait of four months from their women if they revert allah is forgiving the most merciful
2227 but if they resolve on divorce surely allah is the hearer the knower
2228 divorced women shall wait by themselves for three periods it is unlawful for them if they believe in allah and the last day to hide what he has created in their wombs in which case their husbands would have a better right to restore them should they desire reconciliation and for them similar to what is due from them with kindness but men have a degree above them allah is mighty and wise
2229 divorce is twice then an honorable keeping or allowed to go with kindness it is unlawful for you to take from them anything you have given them unless both fear that they will not be able to keep within the bounds of allah in which case it shall be no offense for either of them if she ransom herself these are the bounds of allah do not transgress them those who transgress the bounds of allah are harmdoers
2230 if he divorces her for the third time she shall not be lawful to him after that until she has wed not for the purpose of remarrying her former husband another spouse and then if he divorces her it shall be no offense for either of them to return to each other if they think that they can keep within the bounds of allah those are the bounds of allah he makes them plain to people who know
2231 when you have divorced women and they have reached the end of their waiting period either keep them in kindness or let them go with kindness but you shall not keep them being harmful in order to transgress whoever does this wrongs himself do not take the verses of allah in mockery remember the favor of allah upon you and what he sent down to you from the book and wisdom to exhort you fear allah and know that he has knowledge of everything
2232 when you divorce women and they have reached their term do not restrain them from marrying their future husbands when they have agreed together with kindness that is an exhortation for whosoever of you believes in allah and the last day that is cleaner and purer for you allah knows and you do not know
2233 mothers shall suckle their children for two years completely for whoever desires to fulfill the suckling it is for the father to provide for them and clothe them with kindness no soul is charged except to its capacity a mother shall not be harmed for her child neither a father for his child and upon the heir is like that if both desire to wean by mutual consent and consultation then no guilt shall be on them and if you desire a wet nurse for your children then no guilt shall be on you if you hand over what you have given with kindness and fear allah and know that allah is the seer of what you do
2234 and those of you who die and leave wives behind such wives shall wait by themselves for four months and ten nights when they have reached the end of their waiting period there shall be no offense for you in whatever they choose for themselves kindly allah is aware of what you do
2235 no guilt shall be on you in the indication of an engagement to women or what you suppress in yourself allah knows that you will remember them but do not promise them secretly unless you speak kind words only of indication and do not resolve on the knot of marriage until the writing has reached its term and know that allah knows what is in your hearts so be cautious of him and know that allah is the forgiver the clement
2236 it shall be no offense for you to divorce your wives as long as you have not touched them or obligated a right for them provide for them with fairness the rich according to his means and the restricted according to his a right on the gooddoers
2237 if you divorce them before you have touched them but after their dowry has been determined give them half of what you determined unless they pardon or he pardons in whose hand is the marriage knot and if you pardon it is nearer to wardingoff evil do not forget the generosity between each other allah is the seer of what you do
2238 and preserve the prayers and the middle prayer and stand obedient to allah
2239 and if you fear then pray on foot or riding but when you are safe then remember allah as he has taught you what you did not know
2240 those who die and leave wives behind should bequeath to them a years maintenance without causing them to leave their homes but if they leave no blame shall be attached to you in what they do with themselves kindly allah is mighty and wise
2241 provision should be made for divorced women with kindness that is a right on the cautious
2242 like this allah clarifies to you his verses in order that you understand
2243 havent you seen those who went out from their homes in their thousands cautious of death allah said to them die and then he revived them surely allah is bountiful to the people but most people do not thank
2244 fight in the way of allah and know that allah is the hearer and the knower
2245 who is he that will lend allah a good loan he will multiply it many multiples allah grasps and outspreads and to him you shall be returned
2246 have you not seen the congregation of the children of israel who demanded of one of their prophets after the death of moses raise up for us a king they said and we will fight in the way of allah he replied might it be that if fighting is written for you you will not fight why shouldnt we fight in the way of allah they replied when we and all our children have been driven from our dwellings yet when fighting was written for them all except for a few turned away and allah has knowledge of the harmdoers
2247 their prophet said to them allah has raised saul to be your king but they replied should he be given the kingship over us when we are more deserving of it than he and he has not been given abundant wealth he said allah has chosen him over you and increased him with amplitude in knowledge and body allah gives his kingship to whom he will allah is the embracer the knower
2248 their prophet said to them the sign of his kingship is the coming of the ark to you therein shall be tranquility from your lord and a remnant which the house of moses and the house of aaron left behind it will be borne by the angels that will be a sign for you if you are believers
2249 and when saul marched out with his army he said allah will test you with a river he who drinks from it shall cease to be one of mine but he who does not drink from it except he who scoops up once with his hand shall be of mine but for a few of them they all drank from it and when he had crossed it with those who believed they said we have no power this day against goliath and his soldiers but those of them who reckoned they would meet allah replied many a small band has by the permission of allah vanquished a mighty army allah is with the patient
2250 when they appeared to goliath and his soldiers they said lord pour upon us patience make us firm of foot and give us victory against the nation of unbelievers
2251 by the permission of allah they routed them david slew goliath and allah bestowed on him the kingship and wisdom and taught him from that he willed had allah not pushed the people some by the other the earth would have been corrupted but allah is bountiful to the worlds
2252 these are the verses of allah we recite them to you in truth for you prophet muhammad are one of the messengers
2253 of these messengers we have preferred some above others to some allah spoke and some he raised in rank we gave prophet jesus the son of mary clear signs and strengthened him with the spirit of purity gabriel had allah willed those who succeeded them would not have fought against one another after the clear verses came to them but they differed among themselves some believed and others disbelieved yet had allah willed they would not have fought against one another allah does whatever he will
2254 believers spend of what we have given you before that day arrives when there shall be neither trade nor friendship nor intercession it is the unbelievers who are the harmdoers
2255 allah there is no god except he the living the everlasting neither dozing nor sleep overtakes him to him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth who is he that shall intercede with him except by his permission he knows what will be before their hands and what was behind them and they do not comprehend anything of his knowledge except what he willed his seat embraces the heavens and the earth and the preserving of them does not weary him he is the high the great
2256 there is no compulsion in religion righteousness is now distinct from error he who disbelieves in the idol and believes in allah has grasped the firmest tie that will never break allah is hearing knowing
2257 allah is the guardian of those who believe he brings them out from darkness into the light as for those who disbelieve their guides are idols they bring them out from the light into darkness they are the companions of the fire and shall live in it for ever
2258 have you not seen he who argued with abraham about his lord that allah had given him the kingship when abraham said my lord is he who revives and causes to die he said i revive and cause to die abraham said allah brings up the sun from the east so you bring it from the west then he who disbelieved became pale allah does not guide the nation the harmdoers
2259 or of him who when passing by the ruined village that was fallen on its roofs remarked how can allah give life to this after its death thereupon allahcaused him to die and after a hundred years he revived him he asked how long have you remained a day he replied or part of a day allah said rather you have remained a hundred years look at your food and drink they have not rotted and look at your donkey that had died we will make you a sign to the people and look at the bones of your donkey how we shall revive them and clothe them with flesh and when it had all become clear to him he said i know that allah has power over all things
2260 and remember when abraham said show me lord how you raise the dead he replied have you not believed rather said abraham in order that my heart be satisfied take four birds said he draw them to you then set a part of them on every hill then call them they will come swiftly to you know that allah is mighty and wise
2261 the example of those who give their wealth in the way of allah is like a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears in every ear a hundred grains allah multiplies to whom he will allah is the embracer the knower
2262 those who spend their wealth in the way of allah and do not follow their spending with reproach and insults shall be rewarded by their lord they shall have nothing to fear or to regret
2263 a kind word and forgiveness is better than charity followed by injury allah is the clement
2264 believers do not annul your charitable giving with reproach and hurt like he who spends his wealth to show off to the people and believes neither in allah nor in the last day his likeness is as a smooth rock covered with dust if a heavy rain strikes it it leaves it bare they have no power over what they have earned allah does not guide the nation the unbelievers
2265 but those who give away their wealth with a desire to please allah and to reassure themselves are like a garden on a hillside if heavy rain strikes it it yields up twice its normal crop and if heavy rain does not strike it then light rain allah is the seer of what you do
2266 would any one of you being welladvanced in age with helpless children wish to have a garden of palmtrees vines and all manner of fruits watered by running streams struck and burned by a fiery whirlwind even so allah makes plain to you his signs in order that you give thought
2267 believers spend of the good you have earned and of that which we have brought out of the earth for you and do not intend the bad of it for your spending while you would never take it yourselves except you closed an eye on it know that allah is rich the praised
2268 satan promises you with poverty and orders you to commit what is indecent but allah promises you his forgiveness and bounty from him allah is the embracer the knower
2269 he gives wisdom to whom he will and he who is given wisdom has been given a lot of good yet none will remember except the owners of minds
2270 whatever you spend and whatever vows you make are known to allah the harmdoers shall have none to help them
2271 if you reveal your charity it is good but to give charity to the poor in private is better and will acquit you from some of your evil deeds allah is knowledgeable of what you do
2272 it is not for you prophet muhammad to cause their guidance allah guides whom he will whatever good you spend is for yourselves provided that you give it desiring the face of allah and whatever good you spend shall be repaid to you in full you shall not be harmed
2273 charity is for the poor who are restrained in the way of allah and are unable to journey in the land the ignorant take them to be rich because of their abstinence but you can recognize them by their signs they do not persistently beg people whatever good you give is known to allah
2274 those who spend their wealth by day and by night in private and in public their wage is with their lord and no fear shall be on them neither shall they sorrow
2275 those who consume usury shall not rise up from their tomb except as he who rises in madness that satan has touched that is because they say selling is like usury allah has permitted trading and forbidden usury to whomsoever an exhortation comes from his lord then he desists he shall have his past gains and his matter is with allah but whoever reverts shall be among the people of the fire and shall remain in it for ever
2276 allah effaces usury and nurtures charity allah does not love any ungrateful sinner
2277 those who believe and do good works establish the prayers and pay the obligatory charity will be rewarded by their lord and will have nothing to fear or to regret
2278 believers fear allah and give up what is still due to you from usury if you are believers
2279 but if you do not then take notice of war from allah and his messenger yet if you repent you shall have the principal of your wealth neither will you harm nor will you be harmed
2280 if he should be in hardship then a postponement until ease while if you give charity it is better for you if you know
2281 fear the day when you shall be returned to allah and every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned and they shall not be harmed
2282 believers when you contract a debt for a fixed period put it in writing let a scribe write it down between you with fairness no scribe shall refuse to write as allah has taught him therefore let him write and let the debtor dictate fearing allah his lord and do not decrease anything of it if the debtor is a fool or weak or unable to dictate himself let his guardian dictate for him in fairness call to witness two witnesses of your men if the two are not men then a man and two women from the witnesses whom you approve so that if one of the two errs one of them will remind the other whenever witnesses are called upon they must not refuse and do not be weary to write it down be it small or large together with its term this is more just with allah it ensures accuracy in testifying and is the least of doubt unless it is present merchandise that you circulate between you then no guilt shall be on you if you do not write it down and take witnesses when you are selling and let no harm be done to either scribe or witness if you do that is a transgression in you fear allah allah teaches you and allah has knowledge of everything
2283 if you are upon a journey and a scribe cannot be found then let pledges be taken if any of you trusts another let the trusted deliver his trust and let him fear allah his lord and you shall not conceal the testimony he who conceals it his heart is sinful allah has knowledge of what you do
2284 to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth whether you reveal what is in your hearts or hide it allah will bring you to account for it he will forgive whom he will and punish whom he will he has power over all things
2285 the messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his lord and so do the believers each believes in allah and his angels his books and his messengers we do not differentiate between any one of his messengers they say we hear and obey we ask your forgiveness lord and to you is the arrival
2286 allah charges no soul except to its capacity for it is what it has earned and against it what it has gained our lord do not take us to account if we have forgotten or made a mistake our lord do not burden us with a load as you have burdened those before us our lord do not over burden us with more than we can bear and pardon us and forgive us and have mercy on us you are our guide so give us victory over the nation the unbelievers
31 aliflaammeem
32 allah there is no god except he the living the everlasting
33 he has sent down to you the book with the truth confirming what preceded it and he has sent down the torah and the gospel of prophet jesus which has been lost
34 before as a guidance for people and he sent down the criterion as for those who disbelieve in the verses of allah for them is an intense punishment allah is mighty owner of vengeance
35 nothing on earth or in heaven is hidden from allah
36 it is he who shapes you in your mothers wombs as he wills there is no god except him the almighty the wise
37 it is he who has sent down to you the book some of its verses are precise in meaning they are the foundation of the book and others obscure those whose hearts are swerving with disbelief follow the obscure desiring sedition and desiring its interpretation but no one knows its interpretation except allah those who are wellgrounded in knowledge say we believe in it it is all from our lord and none remember except those who are possessed of minds
38 lord do not cause our hearts to swerve after you have guided us grant us your mercy you are the embracing giver
39 lord you will surely gather all the people for a day that will come in which there is no doubt allah will not break his promise
310 those who disbelieve neither their riches nor their children shall save them from allah they shall become the fuel of the fire
311 like pharaohs people and those before them who belied our revelations allah seized them in their sinfulness allah is firm in inflicting punishment
312 say to those who disbelieve you shall be overcome and gathered into gehenna hell an evil cradling
313 indeed there was a sign for you in the two armies which met on the battlefield one was fighting in the way of allah and another unbelieving they the believers saw with their eyes that they were twice their own number allah strengthens with his victory whom he will surely in that there was a lesson for those possessed of eyes
314 decorated for people are the desires of women offspring and of heaped up piles of gold and silver of pedigree horses cattle and sown fields these are the enjoyments of the worldly life but with allah is the best return
315 say shall i tell you of a better thing than that for the cautious with their lord theirs shall be gardens underneath which rivers flow where they shall live for ever and purified spouses and pleasure from allah allah is watching over his worshipers
316 those are they who say lord we believe in you forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of the fire
317 who are patient truthful obedient and charitable and who ask forgiveness at dawn
318 allah bears witness that there is no god except he and so do the angels and the knowledgeable he upholds justice there is no god except he the mighty the wise
319 the only religion with allah is islam submission those to whom the book was given disagreed among themselves only after knowledge had been given to them being insolent among themselves he who disbelieves the verses of allah indeed allah is swift in reckoning
320 if they argue with you say i have submitted my face to allah and so have those who follow me to those who have received the book jews and nazarenes and to the ignorant ask have you submitted yourselves to allah if they became muslims they were guided if they turn away then your only duty is to warn them allah is watching over all his worshipers
321 those who disbelieve the verses of allah and slay the prophets unjustly and slay those who bid to justice give them the glad tidings of a painful punishment
322 their works shall be annulled in this world and in the everlasting life and there shall be none to help them
323 have you not seen those who have received a portion of the book being called to the book of allah that it might judge between them and some turned away swerving aside
324 for they say the fire will not touch us except for a certain number of days and the lies they forged have deluded them in their religion
325 how will it be when we gather them for a day in which there is no doubt when every soul will be given what it has earned and they will not be wronged
326 say o allah owner of the kingdom you give the kingdom to whom you will and take it away from whom you will you exalt whom you will and abase whom you will in your hand is good you have power over all things
327 you cause the night to enter into the day and the day to enter into the night you bring forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living you provide without reckoning to whom you will
328 the believers should not take the unbelievers as guides in preference to the believers he who does this does not belong to allah in anything unless you have a fear of them allah warns you to be cautious of him the arrival is to allah
329 say whether you hide what is in your hearts or reveal it allah knows it he knows all that is in the heavens and earth and has power over all things
330 the day that every soul shall find what it has done of good brought forward and what it has done of evil it will wish if there were only a far space between it and that day allah warns you to be wary of him and allah is gentle with his worshipers
331 say prophet muhammad if you love allah follow me and allah will love you and forgive your sins allah is forgiving and merciful
332 say obey allah and the messenger but if they turn away then truly allah does not love the unbelievers
333 allah chose adam and noah the house of abraham and the house of imran above all worlds
334 they were the offspring of one another allah is hearing and knowing
335 remember when the wife of imran said lord i have vowed to you in dedication that which is hidden inside me accept this from me you are the hearer the knower
336 and when she was delivered of her she said lord i have given birth to her a female allah knew of what she had given birth the male is not like the female and i have called her mary protect her and all her descendants from satan the stoned one
337 her lord graciously accepted her he made her grow with a fine upbringing and entrusted her to the care of zachariah whenever zachariah went to her in the sanctuary he found that she had provision with her mary he said how does this come to you it is from allah she answered truly allah provides whomsoever he will without reckoning
338 thereupon zachariah supplicated to his lord saying lord give me from you a good offspring you hear all prayers
339 and the angels called out to him when he was standing in the sanctuary worshipping saying allah gives you glad tidings of john who shall confirm a word from allah he shall be a master and chaste a prophet and from the righteous
340 he said lord how shall i have a son when i am overtaken by old age and my wife is barren he said even so allah does what he will
341 he said lord appoint for me a sign he said your sign is that you shall not speak to people except by signs for three days and remember your lord abundantly exalt him in the evening and at the dawn
342 and when the angels said to mary allah has chosen you and purified you he has chosen you above all women of the worlds
343 mary be obedient to your lord prostrate and bow with those who bow
344 this is from the news of the unseen we reveal it to you prophet muhammad you were not present when they cast their quills to see which of them should look after mary nor were you present when they were disputing
345 when the angels said o mary allah gives you glad tidings of a word be from him whose name is messiah jesus the son of mary he shall be honored in this world and in the everlasting life and he shall be among those who are close
346 he shall speak to people in his cradle and when he is aged and shall be among the righteous
347 lord she said how can i bear a child when no human being has touched me he replied such is the will of allah he creates whom he will when he decrees a thing he only says be and it is
348 he will teach him the book the wisdom the torah and the gospel
349 to be a messenger to the children of israel saying i have come to you with a sign from your lord from clay i will create for you the likeness of a bird i shall breathe into it and by the permission of allah it shall be a bird i shall heal the blind and the leper and raise the dead to life by the permission of allah i shall tell you what you ate and what you store in your houses surely that will be a sign for you if you are believers
350 likewise confirming the torah that has been before me and to make lawful to you some of the things you have been forbidden i bring you a sign from your lord therefore fear allah and obey me
351 allah is my lord and your lord therefore worship him this is the straight path
352 when prophet jesus felt their disbelief he said who will be my helpers in the way of allah the disciples replied we are the helpers of allah we believe in allah bear witness that we are submitters muslims
353 lord we have believed in what you sent down and followed the messenger write us among your witnesses
354 they devised and allah devised and allah is the best devisor
355 allah said prophet jesus i will take you to me and will raise you to me and i will purify you from those who disbelieve i will make your followers who died before prophet muhammad above those who disbelieve till the day of resurrection then to me you shall all return and i shall judge between you as to that you were at variance
356 as for those who disbelieve i will sternly punish them in this world and in the everlasting life there shall be none to help them
357 as for those who believe and do good works he will pay them their wages in full allah does not love the harmdoers
358 this we recite to you of the verses and the wise remembrance
359 truly the likeness of prophet jesus with allah is as the likeness of adam he created him from dust then he said to him be and he was
360 the truth is from your lord therefore do not be among the doubters
361 those who dispute with you concerning him after the knowledge has come to you say come let us gather our sons and your sons our womenfolk and your womenfolk ourselves and yourselves then let us humbly pray so lay the curse of allah upon the ones who lie
362 this is indeed the truthful narration there is no god except allah it is allah who is the almighty the wise
363 if they turn away allah knows the evildoers
364 say people of the book let us come to a common word between us and you that we will worship none except allah that we will associate none with him and that none of us take others for lords besides allah if they turn away say bear witness that we are muslims
365 people of the book why do you dispute about abraham when both the torah and the gospel were not sent down till after him have you no sense
366 indeed you have disputed about that which you have knowledge why then dispute about that of which you have no knowledge allah knows and you do not know
367 no abraham was neither a jew nor a nazarene he was of pure faith a submitter muslim he was never of the idolaters
368 surely the people who are nearest to abraham are those who followed him and this prophet muhammad and those who believe allah is the guardian of the believers
369 some of the people of the book wish to make you go astray but they lead none astray except themselves though they do not sense it
370 people of the book why do you disbelieve the verses of allah while you are witness
371 people of the book why do you confound truth with falsehood and knowingly hide the truth
372 some of the people of the book say believe in that which is sent down to those who believe at the beginning of the day and disbelieve at the end of it so that they will return
373 believe none except those who follow your own religion say the true guidance is the guidance of allah that anyone should be given the like of what you have been given or dispute with you before your lord say bounty is in the hand of allah he gives it to whomsoever he will allah is the embracer the knower
374 he singles out for his mercy whom he will and allah is of abundant bounty
375 among the people of the book there are some who if you trust him with a qintar 98 841 6 lbs will return it to you and there are others who if you trust him with a dinar will not hand it back unless you stand over him for they say as for the common people they have no recourse to us they say lies against allah while they know
376 rather those who keep their promise and fear allah allah loves the cautious
377 those who sell the promise of allah and their own oaths for a little price shall have no share in the everlasting life allah will neither speak to them nor look at them nor purify them on the day of resurrection theirs shall be a painful punishment
378 and there is a sect among them who twist their tongues with the book so you will think it is from the book whereas it is not from the book they say this is from allah whereas it is not from allah and they knowingly tell lies against allah
379 no human to whom allah has given the holy book judgement and prophethood would say to the people be worshipers of me other than allah but rather be of the lord for that you teach the book and in that you have studied
380 nor would he order you to take the angels and the prophets for lords what would he order you with disbelief after you were submitters muslims
381 and when allah took the covenant of the prophets that i have given you of the book and wisdom then there shall come to you a messenger muhammad confirming what is with you you shall believe in him and you shall support him to be victorious do you agree and take my load on this they answered we do agree allah said then bear witness and i will be with you among the witnesses
382 whosoever turns back after that they are the transgressors
383 are they seeking a religion other than that of allah and to him whosoever is in the heavens and the earth has submitted willingly and unwillingly to him they shall be returned
384 say we believe in allah and in what is sent down to us and in that which was sent down to abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the tribes and in that which was given to prophets moses and jesus and the prophets from their lord we do not differentiate between any of them to him we are submitters muslims
385 he who chooses a religion other than islam it will not be accepted from him and in the everlasting life he will be among the losers
386 how shall allah guide a people who lapse into disbelief after they believed and bore witness that the messenger is true and after receiving clear proofs allah does not guide the harmdoers
387 those their recompense shall be the curse of allah the angels and all the people
388 there they shall live for ever their punishment shall not be lightened nor shall they be given respite
389 except those who afterwards repent and mend their ways allah is forgiving and the most merciful
390 indeed those who disbelieve after they have believed and increase in disbelief their repentance shall not be accepted these are those who are astray
391 as for those who disbelieve and die unbelievers there shall be not accepted from anyone of them the whole earth full of gold if he would ransom himself thereby those for them there is a painful punishment and none shall help them
392 you shall not attain righteousness until you spend of what you love whatever you spend is known to allah
393 all food was lawful to the children of israel except what israel forbade himself before the torah had been sent down say bring the torah and recite it if you are truthful
394 those who after this invent lies about allah are harmdoers
395 say allah has said the truth follow the creed of abraham he was of pure faith and not an idolater
396 the first house ever to be built for people was that at bakkah mecca blessed and a guidance for the worlds
397 in it there are clear signs the station where abraham stood whoever enters it let him be safe pilgrimage to the house is a duty to allah for all who can make the journey and whosoever disbelieves allah is rich independent of all the worlds
398 say people of the book why do you disbelieve the verses of allah surely allah is witness to all that you do
399 say people of the book why do you bar he who believes from the path of allah and seek to make it crooked when you yourselves are witnesses allah is not inattentive of what you do
3100 believers if you obey a sect of those who were given the book they will turn you into unbelievers after you have believed
3101 how can you disbelieve when the verses of allah are recited to you and his messenger is among you he who holds fast to allah shall be guided to the straight path
3102 believers fear allah as he should be feared and do not die except as muslims
3103 and hold fast to the bond of allah together and do not scatter remember the favor of allah bestowed upon you when you were enemies and how he united your hearts so that by his favor you became brothers and how he saved you from the pit of fire when you were on the brink of it and so allah makes plain to you his verses in order that you will be guided
3104 let there be one nation of you that shall call to righteousness ordering honor and forbidding dishonor those are the prosperous
3105 do not follow the example of those who became divided and differed with one another after clear proofs had come to them for those there is a great punishment
3106 the day when faces will be whitened and faces blackened to those whose faces have become blackened it will be said did you disbelieve after you had believed then taste the punishment for that you disbelieved
3107 as for those whose faces will be whitened they shall be in the mercy of allah for ever
3108 such are the verses of allah we recite them to you with truth allah does not want injustice for the worlds
3109 to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth to him all matters shall return
3110 you are the best nation ever to be brought forth for people you order honor and forbid dishonor and you believe in allah had the people of the book believed it would have surely been better for them some of them are believers but most of them are evildoers
3111 they will not harm you except a little hurt and if they fight against you they will turn their backs then they will not be victorious
3112 abasement shall be pitched upon them wherever they are found except they are in a bond from allah and a bond of the people they have incurred theanger of allah and have been humiliated because they disbelieved the verses of allah and unjustly slew his prophets and because they disobeyed and were transgressors
3113 yet they are not all alike there are among the people of the book an upstanding nation that recite the verses of allah the koran throughout the night and prostrate themselves
3114 who believe in allah and the last day who order honor and forbid dishonor and race in good works these are the righteous
3115 whatever good they do for them it shall not be denied allah knows the cautious
3116 as for those who disbelieve neither their riches nor their children shall help them a thing from allah they are the people of the fire and there they shall remain for ever
3117 the wealth they spend in this worldly life is like a freezing wind that smites the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves and destroys it allah has not wronged them but they wronged themselves
3118 believers do not take intimates with other than your own they spare nothing to ruin you they yearn for you to suffer hatred has already shown itself from their mouths and what their chests conceal is yet greater indeed we have made clear to you the signs if you understand
3119 there you are loving them and they do not love you you believe in the entire book when they meet you they say we believe but when alone they bite their fingertips at you out of rage say die in your rage allah has knowledge of what is in your chests
3120 when you are touched with good fortune they grieve but when evil befalls you they rejoice if you are patient and cautious their guile will never harm you allah encompasses what they do
3121 and when you went out at dawn from your family to lodge the believers in their positions for the battle allah is hearing knowing
3122 two parties of you were about to fail though allah was their guardian and in allah believers put all their trust
3123 and allah most assuredly helped you at badr when you were humiliated therefore fear allah in order that you will give thanks to him
3124 when you said to the believers is it not enough for you that your lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down upon you
3125 rather if you have patience and are cautious and they suddenly come against you your lord will reinforce you with five thousand marked angels
3126 allah did not make this to be except as glad tidings for you so that your hearts might be comforted victory comes only from allah the mighty the wise
3127 and that he might cut off a part of those who disbelieve or suppress them so that they will turn back disappointed
3128 no part of the matter is yours whether he turns towards them or punishes them they are harmdoers
3129 to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth he forgives whom he will and punishes whom he will allah is forgiving the most merciful
3130 believers do not consume usury doubled and redoubled and fear allah in order that you shall prosper
3131 guard yourselves against the fire prepared for unbelievers
3132 obey allah and the messenger in order to be subjected to mercy
3133 and hasten to a forgiveness from your lord and a paradise as wide as heaven and earth prepared for the cautious
3134 who spend in prosperity and in adversity for those who curb their anger and those who forgive people and allah loves the charitable
3135 and those who if they commit indecency or wrong themselves remember allah and ask forgiveness of their sins for who but allah forgives sins and those who do not persist in what they do while they know
3136 those their recompense is forgiveness from their lord and gardens underneath which rivers flow where they shall live for ever how excellent is the wage of those who labor
3137 there have been examples before you journey in the land and see what was the fate of the liars
3138 this is a declaration to the people a guidance and an admonition to the cautious
3139 do not be weak neither sorrow while you are the upper ones if you are believers
3140 if a wound touches you a similar wound already has touched the nation such days we alternate between the people so that allah knows those who believe and that he will take witnesses from among you for allah does not love the harmdoers
3141 and so that allah will examine those who believe and efface the unbelievers
3142 did you suppose that you would enter paradise without allah knowing those of you who struggled and who were patient
3143 you used to wish for death before you met it so you have seen it while you were looking
3144 muhammad is not except a messenger messengers have passed away before him if he dies or is killed will you turn about on your heels and he who turns on his heels will not harm allah a thing allah will recompense the thankful
3145 it is not for any soul to die except by the permission of allah a postponed book and he who desires the reward of this world we shall give him of it and he who desires the reward of the everlasting life we shall give him of it and we will recompense the thankful
3146 there has been many a prophet with whom many of the lord have fought and they did not faint when they were smitten in the way of allah neither did they weaken nor did they humble themselves and allah loves the patient
3147 their only words were lord forgive us our sins and that we exceeded in our affair make us firm of foot and give us victory over the unbelievers
3148 and allah gave them the reward of this life and the best reward of the everlasting life allah loves the gooddoers
3149 believers if you obey those who disbelieve they will turn you upon your heels and you will turn to be losers
3150 but allah is your sponsor he is the best of victors
3151 we will throw terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve for that they have associated with allah that which he did not send down for a proof fire shall be their home evil indeed is the dwellingplace of the harmdoers
3152 allah has been true in his promise towards you when you routed them by his leave until you lost heart and quarreled about the matter and disobeyed afterhe had shown you that which you loved some among you wanted the world and some among you wanted the everlasting life then he made you turn away from them in order to test you but he has forgiven you for allah is bounteous to the believers
3153 and when you were going up and paid no heed for anyone and the messenger was calling you from behind so he rewarded you with grief upon grief that you might not sorrow for what escaped you neither for what smote you and allah is aware of what you do
3154 then after sorrow he sent down upon you safety slumber overtook a party while another party cared only for themselves thinking of allah thoughts that were not true the guess of ignorance saying have we any say in the affair say the entire affair belongs to allah they conceal in themselves what they do not disclose to you they say if we had any say in the affair we should not have been killed here say had you stayed in your homes those of you for whom slaying was written would have come out to their death beds so that allah might try what was in your chests and that he will examine what is in your hearts and allah knows the innermost of the chests
3155 those of you who turned away on the day when the two armies met must have been seduced by satan on account of some of what they had earned but allah has pardoned them he is forgiving and clement
3156 believers do not be as those who disbelieve and say of their brothers when they journey in the land or go of to battle had they stayed with us they would not have died nor would they have been killed in order that allah will make that a regret in their hearts allah revives and causes to die he has knowledge of what you do
3157 if you should be killed in the way of allah or die the forgiveness and mercy from allah would surely be better than all you amass
3158 and if you die or are killed before allah you shall all be gathered
3159 it was by that mercy of allah that you prophet muhammad dealt so leniently with them had you been harsh and hardhearted they would have surely deserted you therefore pardon them and ask forgiveness for them take counsel with them in the matter and when you are resolved put your trust in allah allah loves those who trust
3160 if allah helps you none can overcome you if he forsakes you who then can help you after him therefore in allah let the believers put all their trust
3161 it is not for a prophet to defraud whosoever defrauds shall bring that fraud on the day of resurrection then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned and they shall not be wronged
3162 is he who follows the pleasure of allah like he who is laden with the anger of allah gehenna hell shall be his shelter evil shall be his return
3163 they are in ranks with allah allah sees what they do
3164 allah has surely been gracious to the believers when he sent among them a messenger from themselves to recite to them his verses to purify them and to teach them the book and the wisdom prophetic sayings though before that they were in clear error
3165 why when an affliction hits you and that you had yourselves inflicted twice the like of it you said how is this say this is from your own selves surely allah has power over all things
3166 what hit you the day the two armies met was by the permission of allah so that he might know the believers
3167 and that he might know the hypocrites when it was said to them come fight or repel in the way of allah they replied if only we knew how to fight we would follow you on that day they were nearer to disbelief than belief they said with their mouths what was not in their hearts and allah knows what they hide
3168 who said to their brothers and they themselves had stayed behind had they obeyed us they would not have been killed say to them avert death from yourselves then if what you say is true
3169 you must not think that those who were killed in the way of allah are dead but rather they are alive with their lord and have been provided for
3170 rejoicing in the bounty that allah has given to them and having glad tidings in those who remain behind and have not joined them for no fear shall be on them neither shall they sorrow
3171 having glad tidings of a favor and bounty from allah allah will not waste the wage of the believers
3172 those who answered allah and the messenger after the wound had afflicted them for those of them who did good and were cautious there is a great wage
3173 those to whom the people said the people have gathered against you therefore fear them but it increased them in belief and they said allah is sufficient for us he is the best guardian
3174 so they returned with the favor and bounty of allah so evil did not touch them they followed the pleasure of allah and allah is of great bounty
3175 that is satan frightening those whom he sponsored so do not fear them and fear me if you are believers
3176 do not let those who race in disbelief sadden you they will not harm allah a thing allah does not want to give them a share in the everlasting life for them is a great punishment
3177 those who buy disbelief with belief will not harm allah a thing for them there is a painful punishment
3178 do not let those who disbelieve think that what we delay is better for them indeed we delay for them only that they will increase in sin and for them a humiliating punishment
3179 allah will not leave the believers in that which you are till he shall distinguish the evil from the good allah will not let you see the unseen but allah chooses from his messengers whom he will therefore believe in allah and his messengers for if you believe and are cautious there shall be for you a great wage
3180 and do not let those who are greedy with what allah has given them of his bounty think it is better for them but rather it is worse for them they will be coiled in that which they were greedy on the day of resurrection and to allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth and allah is aware of what you do
3181 allah has heard the saying of those who said allah is poor but we are rich we will write down what they have said and their slaying of the prophets without right and we shall say taste the punishment of the burning
3182 that is for what your hands have forwarded and allah is never unjust to his worshipers
3183 those the jews who say allah has promised us that we do not believe in a messenger unless he brings to us an offering that fire consumes say indeed messengers have come to you before me with clear proofs and with that of which you spoke why did you kill them if what you say is true
3184 if they belie you prophet muhammad indeed other messengers before you were belied who came with clear proofs and the psalms and the illuminating book
3185 every soul shall taste death you shall be paid your wages in full on the day of resurrection whoever is removed from hell and is admitted to paradise shall prosper for the worldly life is nothing but the enjoyment of delusion
3186 you shall be tried in your wealth and yourselves and you shall hear much hurt from those who were given the book before you and from those who are idolaters but if you are patient and cautious surely that is of the firm affairs
3187 when allah took a covenant with those to whom the book was given saying you shall make it clear to the people and not conceal it but they threw it behind their backs and they bought with it a little price evil was what they bought
3188 do not think that those who rejoice in what they have brought and love to be praised for what they have not done do not think they will be secure from the punishment and for them there is a painful punishment
3189 to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth allah has power over all things
3190 surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alternation of night and day there are signs for those with minds
3191 those who remember allah when standing sitting and on their sides and contemplate upon the creation of the heavens and the earth saying lord you have not created these in falsehood exaltations to you guard us against the punishment of the fire
3192 our lord whomsoever you admit into the fire you will have abased and the harmdoers shall have no helpers
3193 our lord we have heard the caller calling to belief believe in your lord so we believe our lord forgive us our sins and acquit us of our evil deeds and take us to you in death with the righteous
3194 our lord give us what you promised us by your messengers and do not abase us on the day of resurrection you do not break your promise
3195 and indeed their lord answers them i do not waste the labor of any that labors among you male or female you are from each other and those who emigrated and were expelled from their houses those who suffered hurt in my way and fought and were killed those i shall surely acquit of their evil deeds and i shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow a reward from allah and allah with him is the best reward
3196 do not let the coming and going in the land of those who disbelieve delude you
3197 a little enjoyment then their shelter is in gehenna hell an evil cradling
3198 but for those who fear their lord for them shall be gardens underneath which rivers flow there they shall live for ever a goodly hosting from allah and that which is with allah is better for the righteous
3199 there are some among the people of the book who believe in allah and in what has been sent down to you and what has been sent down to them humble to allah and do not buy with the verses of allah a little price those their wage shall be with their lord allah is swift at reckoning
3200 believers be patient and race in patience be steadfast fear allah in order that you will be victorious
41 o people fear your lord who created you from a single soul from it he created its spouse and from both of them scattered many men and women fear allah by whom you ask one another and fear the wombs lest you sever its relationship allah is ever watching over you
42 give the orphans their wealth do not exchange the evil for the good nor consume their wealth with your wealth surely that is a great sin
43 if you fear that you cannot act justly towards the orphans then marry such women as seem good to you two three four of them but if you fear that you cannot do justice then one only or those you possess it is likelier then that you will not be partial
44 give women their dowries freely but if they are pleased to offer you any of it consume it good and smooth
45 do not give the orphaned fools your wealth with which allah has entrusted you for their support and provide for them and clothe them from it and speak to them with kind words
46 and test the orphans until they reach the age of marriage if you perceive in them right judgment hand over to them their wealth and do not consume it wastefully nor hastily before they are grown and whosoever is rich let him abstain if poor let him consume with kindness when you hand over to them their wealth take witness over them it is sufficient that allah is the reckoner
47 men shall have a share in what their parents and kinsmen leave and women shall have a share in what their parents and kinsmen leave whether it is little or abundant it is an obligated share
48 if relatives orphans or the needy are present at the division of the inheritance provide for them out of it and speak to them in kind words
49 and let them fear who if they themselves left behind weak offspring would be afraid for them and let them fear allah and speak exactly
410 those who consume the wealth of orphans wrongfully only consume fire in their bellies and they shall roast in the blaze
411 allah charges you concerning your children for a male like the share of two females if they are women above two they shall have two thirds of what he left but if she is one then to her a half while for his parents to each one of the two a sixth of what he left if he has a child but if he has no child and his heirs are his parents his mother shall have a third if he has siblings to his mother a sixth after any bequest he had bequeathed or any debt your fathers and your children you do not know which of them is nearer in benefit to you this is an obligation from allah surely allah is the knower the wise
412 for you half of what your wives leave if they have no child if they have a child a quarter of what they leave shall be yours after any bequest she had bequeathed or any debt and for them the females they shall inherit one quarter of what you leave if you have no child if you have a child they shall inherit one eighth after any bequest you had bequeathed or any debt if a man or a woman have no direct heirs but have a brother or a sister to each of the two a sixth if they are more than that they shall equally share the third after any bequest that he had bequeathed or any debt without harm this is an obligation from allah he is the knower the clement
413 such are the bounds of allah he who obeys allah and his messenger he will admit him to gardens underneath which rivers flow that is a great wining
414 and he who disobeys allah and his messenger and transgresses his bounds he will admit him to a fire and shall live in it for ever for him there is a humiliating punishment
415 if any of your women commit indecency call in four witnesses from among yourselves against them if they testify confine them to their houses till death overtakes them or till allah makes for them a way
416 if two among you commit it punish them both if they repent and make amends leave them alone allah is the relenter the merciful
417 allah accepts the repentance from only those who commit evil in ignorance and then quickly turn to him in repentance allah will relent towards them allah is knowing wise
418 allah will accept no repentance from those who do evil deeds until death comes to one of them he says now i repent nor those who die unbelieving for those we have prepared a painful punishment
419 believers it is unlawful for you to inherit women forcefully neither bar them in order that you go off with part of what you have given them except when they commit a clear indecency live with them honorably if you hate them it may be that you hate something which allah has set in it much good
420 if you wish to take a wife in the place of another wife and you have given to one a qintar 98 841 6 lbs so do not take from it anything what will you take it by way of calumny and a clear sin
421 how can you take it back when you have reached one another sexually and they have taken from you a strong covenant
422 and do not marry women your fathers married unless it is a thing of the past surely that was an indecency hated and a way of evil
423 forbidden to you are your mothers your daughters your sisters your paternal aunts and maternal aunts your brothers daughters your sisters daughters your mothers who have given suck to you your suckling sisters your wives mothers and your stepdaughters who are in your care from your wives with whom you have lain but if you have never lain with them it is no fault in you also forbidden to you are the wives of your sons who are of your loins and to take to you two sisters together unless it is a thing of the past allah is the forgiver and the most merciful
424 and forbidden to you are married women except those whom your right hand owns such allah has written for you lawful to you beyond all that is that you can seek using your wealth in marriage and not fornication so whatever you have enjoyed from them give them their obligated wage and there is no fault in you in what ever you mutually agree after the obligation allah is the knower the wise
425 if any one of you do not have the affluence to be able marry free believing women let him marry from among the believing women that your right hand owns allah knows best your belief you are from each other marry them with the permission of their people and give them their wages dowry honorably being women in marriage and chaste not taking lovers if after marriage they commit adultery they shall be liable to half the punishment of a married free woman that is for those of you who fear fornication but it is better for you to be patient allah is the forgiver the most merciful
426 allah wishes to make this clear to you and to guide you along the ways of those who have gone before you and turns towards you and allah is the knower the wise
427 allah wishes to turn towards you but those who follow their lower desires wish you to greatly swerve away
428 allah wishes to lighten for you the jurisprudence and humans are created weak
429 believers do not consume your wealth among yourselves in falsehood except there be trading by your mutual agreement and do not kill yourselves allah is the most merciful to you
430 but whosoever does that in transgression and wrongfully we shall roast him in the fire that is an easy matter for allah
431 if you avoid the major sins that are forbidden to you we shall pardon your evil deeds and admit you by an entrance of honor
432 do not wish for the bounty which allah has preferred one of you above another for men is a share of what they earn and for women is a share of what they earn ask allah of his bounty allah has knowledge of all things
433 to everyone we have made heirs of that which parents and kinsmen leave and those with whom you have sworn an agreement so give to them their share allah is witness over everything
434 men are the maintainers of women for that allah has preferred in bounty one of them over another and for that they have spent of their wealth righteous women are obedient guarding in secret that which allah has guarded those from whom you fear rebelliousness admonish them and desert them in the bed and smack them without harshness then if they obey you do not look for any way against them allah is high great
435 if you fear a breach between them send for an arbiter from his people and an arbiter from her people if both wish reconciliation allah will bring success between them allah is the knower the aware
436 worship allah and do not associate anything with him be kind to parents and near kinsmen to the orphans and to the needy to your neighbor who is your kindred and to the neighbor at your far side and the companion at your side and to the destitute traveler and to that which your right hands owns allah does not love he who is proud and struts
437 or those who are greedy and order other people to be greedy who themselves conceal the bounty that allah has given them and we have prepared a humiliating punishment for the unbelievers
438 and those who spend their wealth to showoff to people and neither believe in allah nor in the last day whosoever has satan for a companion he is an evil companion
439 what harm could befall them if they believed in allah and the last day and spent of what allah provided them with allah is knowledgeable of them all
440 surely allah shall not harm so much as the weight of an atom and if it is a good deed he will double it and give from his own a great wage
441 how then shall it be when we bring forward from every nation a witness and bring you prophet muhammad to witness against those
442 on that day those who disbelieved and have disobeyed the messenger muhammad will wish that the earth might be leveled with them and they will not conceal a statement from allah
443 believers do not come close to prayer when you are drunk until you know what you are saying nor when you are in a state of impurity unless you are crossing through the way prayer area until you have bathed yourselves if you are ill or on a journey or if any of you comes from the toilet or you have touchedwomen and you cannot find water so touch pure dust and wipe your faces and your hands allah is the pardoner the forgiver
444 have you not seen those to whom a portion of the book was given purchasing error and wishing that you should err from the path
445 but allah knows best your enemies it is sufficient that allah is the guardian and it is sufficient that allah is the helper
446 some jews tampered with the words altering their places saying we have heard and we disobey and hear without hearing and observe us raina in hebrew means evil  twisting with their tongues traducing religion but if they had said we have heard and obey and hear and regard us it would have been better for them and more upright but allah has cursed them for their disbelief so they do not believe except a few
447 you to whom the book was given believe in that which we have sent down confirming that which you have before we obliterate faces and turn them on their backs or curse them as we cursed the people of the sabbath and the command of allah is done
448 allah does not forgive the sin of inventing an association with him but he forgives other sins to whomsoever he will he who associates with allah has invented a great sin
449 have you not seen those who exalt themselves rather allah purifies whom he will and they shall not be wronged a single tissue that covers a date stone
450 look how they forge lies against allah and it is sufficient for a clear sin
451 have you not seen those to whom a portion of the book was given believing in the two statutes of mecca jibt and taghout and say to those who disbelieve those are more guided on the way than those who believe
452 those are they whom allah has cursed and whosoever allah has cursed you will not find any helper for him
453 or will they have a share in the kingdom if so they will not give the people the pit mark of a date stone
454 or do they envy people for the bounty allah has given them we gave the family of abraham the book and wisdom and a great kingdom
455 there are some of them who believed in him prophet muhammad and some of them that bar from it and gehenna hell is sufficient for a blaze
456 those who disbelieve our verses we will roast them in a fire as often as their skins are cooked we exchange their skin with another in order that they taste the punishment surely allah is mighty the wise
457 as for those who believe and do good works we shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow they are there for eternity and for them purified spouses and we shall admit them into plenteous shade
458 allah orders you all to hand back trusts to their owners and when you judge between people you judge with justice indeed the best is the exhortation with which allah exhorts you allah is the hearer the seer
459 believers obey allah and obey the messenger and those in authority among you should you dispute about anything refer it to allah and the messenger if you believe in allah and the last day that is better and the best interpretation
460 have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you they desire to be judged by the idol although they have been commanded to disbelieve it but satan desires to lead them astray into far error
461 when it is said to them come to what allah has sent down and to the messenger you see the hypocrites completely barring the way to you
462 how would it be if some affliction hit them for what their hands have forwarded then they would come to you swearing by allah we sought only kindness and conciliation
463 those allah knows what is in their hearts so turn away from them and exhort them and say to them penetrating words about themselves
464 we did not send a messenger except that he should be obeyed by the permission of allah if when they wronged themselves they had come to you and asked allah for forgiveness and the messenger had asked for forgiveness for them they would have found allah the turner the most merciful
465 but no by your lord they will not believe you until they make you the judge regarding the disagreement between them then they will not find in themselves any discomfort concerning your verdict and will surrender to you in full submission
466 had we written for them saying slay yourselves or emerge from your houses they would not have done so except a few of them yet if they had done as they were exhorted it would have been better for them and stronger in firmness
467 and then we would surely have given them from our own a great wage
468 and guided them to a straight path
469 whosoever obeys allah and the messenger they are with those whom allah has favored the prophets the sincere the martyrs and the righteous and these are the best company
470 this is the bounty of allah it is sufficient that allah is the knowledgeable
471 believers take your precautions march in detachments or march all together
472 surely there are among you he who lingers then if an affliction hits you he would say allah has favored me that i was not a martyr with them
473 but if the bounty of allah reaches you he would surely say as if there had never been any affection between you and him would that i had been with them i should have indeed won a great triumph
474 so let those who sell the worldly life for the everlasting life fight in the way of allah whoever fights in the way of allah and is killed or conquers we shall give him a great wage
475 so why is it that you do not fight in the way of allah and for the abased among men women and children who say our lord bring us out from this village whose people are harmdoers and give to us a guardian from you and give to us a helper from you
476 and those who believe fight in the way of allah but those who disbelieve fight in the way of the idol therefore fight against those guided by satan indeed satans guile is always weak
477 have you not seen those to whom it has been said restrain your hands establish your prayers and pay the obligatory charity then as soon as fighting is written for them there is a party of them fearing people as they would fear allah or with stronger fear and they say our lord why have you written fighting for us why not postpone us to a near term say the pleasure of this life is little the everlasting life is better for the cautious you shall not be wronged a single tissue of the fine skin that covers a date stone
478 wherever you are death will overtake you even if you shall be in the fortified high towers if bounty reaches them they say this is from allah but when evil hits them they say this is from you say to them all is from allah what is the matter with this people that they scarcely understand any statement
479 whatever good reaches you it is from allah and whatever evil reaches you it is from yourself we have sent you prophet muhammad as a messenger to humanity allah is sufficient for a witness
480 whosoever obeys the messenger indeed he has obeyed allah as for those who turn away we have not sent you to be their protector
481 they say obedience but as soon as they leave you a party of them hide other than what they said allah writes down what they hide so turn away from them and rely on allah allah is sufficient for a guardian
482 will they not contemplate upon the koran if it had been from other than allah they would surely have found in it many contradictions
483 when a matter comes to them be it of security or fear they broadcast it whereas if they returned it to the messenger and to those in authority among them those of them whose task is to research it would have known it if it was not for the bounty of allah and his mercy all but a few of you would have followed satan
484 therefore fight in the way of allah you are only responsible for yourself urge the believers on in order that allah may restrain the might of those who disbelieve allah is stronger in might and stronger in punishment
485 whosoever intercedes with a good intercession shall receive a share of it and whosoever intercedes with a bad intercession shall receive a portion of it allah has power over all things
486 and when you are greeted with a greeting greet with better than it or return it allah is the reckoner of all things
487 allah there is no god except he he will gather you to the resurrection day there is no doubt in it and who is truer in statement than allah
488 what is the matter with you that you are two parties concerning the hypocrites when allah has overthrown them for what they earned would you desire to guide those whom allah has caused to be led astray whosoever allah leads astray you will not find for him a way
489 they wish that you would disbelieve as they disbelieve and then you would be equal therefore do not take a guide from them until they emigrate in the way of allah then if they turn back take them and kill them wherever you find them do not take them for guides or helpers
490 except those who join to a nation in which there is between you and them a treaty or they come to you with their chests constricted from fighting you or fighting their nation had allah willed he would have given them power over you and then they would have certainly fought you therefore if they keep away from you and do not fight you offering you peace then allah does not make any way for you against them
491 you will find others desiring to be secure from you and secure from their own nation whenever they are called back to sedition they plunge into it if they do not keep away from you and offer you peace and restrain their hands take them and kill them wherever you find them those over them we give you clear authority
492 it is not for a believer to kill another believer except that it is by error whosoever kills a believer in error let him free a believing slave and ransom is to be handed to his family unless they forgo being charitable if he belonged to a people who are your enemies and is a believer then the setting free of a believing slave if he belonged to a people in which there is between you and them a treaty then a ransom is to be handed to his family and the setting free of a believing slave but if he does not find the means let him fast two consecutive months in repentance to allah and allah is the knower the wise
493 the recompense for he who kills a believer deliberately is gehenna hell he is eternal there allah will be angry with him and will curse him and prepare for him a great punishment
494 believers if you are journeying in the way of allah do not say to those who offer you peace until it has been clarified you are not believers seeking the enjoyment of the worldly life with allah there are many spoils you were like that before and allah has been gracious to you therefore let it be clarified surely allah is aware of what you do
495 believers who stay behind having no injury are not equal to those who fight in the way of allah with their wealth and their souls allah has preferred those who fight with their wealth and their souls a degree above those who stay behind because of sickness yet to each allah has promised the most excellent paradise and allah has preferred those who fought over those who stayed behind with a great wage
496 ranks from him forgiveness and mercy allah is the forgiver the most merciful
497 and the angels who take those who wronged themselves will say in what condition were you they will reply we were oppressed in the land they the angels will say was not the earth of allah wide enough for you in order that you migrate in it those their shelter will be gehenna hell an evil arrival
498 except the men women and children who being abased have no means and they are unable to guide themselves to a way
499 those allah may pardon them he is the pardoner the forgiver
4100 whosoever emigrates in the way of allah shall find in the land numerous refuges and abundance whosoever leaves his house an immigrant to allah and his messenger and then death overtakes him his wage shall have fallen upon allah allah is the forgiver the most merciful
4101 and when you are journeying in the land there is no fault in you that you shorten the prayer if you fear that those who disbelieve will afflict you indeed the unbelievers are a clear enemy for you
4102 when you are with them and establish the prayer let a party of them stand with you and let them take their weapons after making their prostrations let them be behind you and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with you taking their precautions and their weapons those who disbelieve wish that you should be inattentive of your weapons and your baggage so that they might swoop upon you with one assault but there is no fault in you if you are harmed by rain or you are sick to lay aside your weapons but take your precautions allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the unbelievers
4103 when you have established the prayer remember allah standing sitting and on your sides then when you are secure establish the prayer surely prayer is timely written upon the believer
4104 and do not be weak in seeking out the people if you are suffering they are also suffering as you are suffering but you are hoping from allah that which they do not hope allah is the knower the wise
4105 surely we have sent down to you the book with the truth so that you will rule between the people by that allah has shown you so do not be an advocate for the traitors
4106 and ask the forgiveness of allah surely allah is the forgiver the most merciful
4107 and do not argue on behalf of those who betray themselves surely allah does not love the sinful traitor
4108 they seek to hide themselves from the people but they do not hide themselves from allah for he is with them when they hide the saying that does not please him allah encompasses what they do
4109 there you are you have argued on their behalf in the worldly life but who will argue with allah on their behalf on the day of resurrection or who will be a guardian for them
4110 he who does evil or wrongs himself and then asks forgiveness of allah will find that allah is the forgiver the most merciful
4111 whosoever earns a sin he only earns it against himself allah is the knower the wise
4112 whosoever earns a fault or a sin and casts it upon the innocent indeed he bears the slander and a clear sin
4113 but for the favor of allah to you prophet muhammad and his mercy a party of them intended to lead you astray but they only lead themselves astray and they did not harm you a thing allah has sent down to you the book and the wisdom and he has taught you what you did not know the bounty of allah to you is ever great
4114 there is no good in much of their confiding except for he who bids to charity honor or reforms between people whosoever does that for the sake of the pleasure of allah we shall give him a great wage
4115 but whosoever opposes the messenger after guidance has been made clear to him and follows a path other than that of the believers we shall let him follow what he has turned to and we shall roast him in gehenna hell an evil arrival
4116 allah does not forgive the sin of inventing an association with him but he forgives other sins to whomsoever he will whosoever associates with allah has gone astray in far error
4117 instead of him they supplicate to none but females and indeed they supplicate to none except the rebellious satan
4118 whom allah has cursed and he satan said indeed i will take to myself an appointed portion of your worshipers
4119 and lead them astray i shall fill them with fancies and order them to cut off the ears of cattle i shall order them to alter the creation of allah indeed whosoever chooses satan for a guide instead of allah has surely suffered a clear loss
4120 he promises them and fills them with fancies but what satan promises them is only a delusion
4121 those their shelter will be gehenna hell and from it they shall find no refuge
4122 but those who believe and do good works we shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow and there they shall live for ever the promise of allah is true and who is truer in speech than allah
4123 it is not by your fancies nor by the fancies of the people of the book whosoever does evil shall be recompensed for it and he will not find for himself other than allah a guardian or helper
4124 but whosoever does good works of righteousness whether they be a believing male or female shall enter paradise and not be wronged a pit mark of a date stone
4125 and who is better in religion than he who submits his face to allah being a gooddoer and follows the creed of abraham pure in faith allah took abraham for a close friend
4126 to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth allah encompasses everything
4127 they will ask you for a verdict concerning women say allah decides for you concerning them and what has been recited in the book concerning orphaned women to whom you do not give what is written and yet desire to marry them and the abased children and that you secure justice for orphans whatever good you do allah has knowledge it
4128 if a woman fears hatred or aversion from her husband there is no fault in them if the couple set things right between them for reconciliation is better avarice attends the souls but if you do what is good and are cautious surely allah is aware of what you do
4129 you will not be able to be just between your women even though you are eager do not be altogether partial so that you leave her as if she were suspended if you reform and are cautious allah is the forgiver the merciful
4130 but if they separate allah will enrich each of them out from his vastness he is the embracer the wise
4131 to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and earth we have charged those who were given the book before you and you to fear allah if you disbelieve to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth allah is rich the praised
4132 to allah belongs all that is in heaven and earth it is sufficient that allah is a guardian
4133 o people if he will he could make you extinct and bring others surely allah is powerful over that
4134 whosoever desires the reward of the world with allah is the reward of the world and of the everlasting life allah is the hearer the seer
4135 believers be maintainers of justice and witnesses for allah even though it is against yourselves your parents or your kinsmen whether he is rich or poor allah has more rights over both of them so do not follow desires so that you are not just if you twist or turn allah is aware of what you do
4136 believers believe in allah and his messenger muhammad in the book he has sent down to his messenger and in the book he sent down before whosoever disbelieves in allah his angels his books his messengers and the last day has surely gone astray into far error
4137 those who believe and then disbelieve and then believe and then disbelieve and increase in disbelief allah is not to forgive them nor guide them on a way
4138 give glad tidings to the hypocrites that for them there is a painful punishment
4139 those who take unbelievers for guides instead of believers are they seeking might with them surely the might altogether belongs to allah
4140 he has sent down upon you in the book when you hear his verses being disbelieved or mocked do not sit with them until they engage in other talk or elseyou will surely be like them allah will surely gather the hypocrites and unbelievers altogether in gehenna hell
4141 as for those who lay in wait for you if a victory comes to you from allah they say were we not with you but if the unbelievers get a portion they say were we not mightier than you and did we not defend you from the believers allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection allah will not grant the unbelievers any way over the believers
4142 the hypocrites seek to deceive allah but allah is deceiving them when they stand up to pray they stand up lazily showing off to the people and do not remember allah except a little
4143 wavering between belief and disbelief neither to these nor to those and whom allah leads astray you will not find a way for him
4144 believers do not take the unbelievers for guides instead of the believers or do you desire to give allah a clear authority over you
4145 the hypocrites will be in the lowest place of the fire you will not find a helper for them
4146 but those who repent and mend their ways who hold fast to allah and make their religion sincerely for allah they are with the believers and allah will certainly give the believers a great wage
4147 what would allah do with punishing you if you thank and believe allah is the thanker the knower
4148 allah does not love the shouting of evil words except by he who has been wronged he is the hearer the knower
4149 if you display good or hide it or pardon an evil surely allah is the pardoner the powerful
4150 those who disbelieve in allah and his messengers and desire to divide between allah and his messengers by believing in him without them and say we believe in some prophets moses and jesus and disbelieve in some of them such as prophet muhammad desiring to take between this and that a way between belief and disbelief
4151 those in truth are the unbelievers and we have prepared for the unbelievers a humiliating punishment
4152 and those who believe in allah and his messengers and do not divide between any of them to those we shall surely give them their wages allah is the forgiver the most merciful
4153 the people of the book ask you to bring down upon them a book from heaven of moses they asked greater than that they said to him show us allah openly and a thunderbolt took them for their evil doing then they took to themselves the calf after the clear proofs had come to them yet we forgave that and we gave moses clear authority
4154 and we raised the mount above them and took covenant with them and we said enter in at the gate prostrating and we said to them do not transgress the sabbath and we took from them a solemn covenant
4155 so for their breaking of the covenant and disbelieving the verses of allah and killing their prophets without right and for saying our hearts are covered no but allah has sealed them for their disbelief so except for a few they do not believe
4156 also for their disbelief and their saying about mary a great calumny
4157 and for their saying we killed the messiah jesus the son of mary the messenger and prophet of allah they did not kill him nor did they crucify him but to them he the crucified had been given the look of prophet jesus those who differ concerning him prophet jesus are surely in doubt regarding him they have no knowledge of him except the following of supposition and it is a certainty they did not kill him
4158 rather allah raised him up to him allah is almighty the wise
4159 there is not one of the people of the book but will surely believe in him prophet jesus before his death and on the day of resurrection he will be a witness against them
4160 and for the harmdoing of those of jewry we have forbidden them the good things that were permitted to them and also for their barring many from the way of allah
4161 and for their taking of usury that they were prohibited and consuming the wealth of people in falsehood for the unbelievers among them we have prepared a painful punishment
4162 but those of them that are firmly rooted in knowledge and the believers believing in what has been sent down to you prophet muhammad and what was sent down before you and those who establish the prayer and pay the obligatory charity and those who believe in allah and the last day to those we surely give a great wage
4163 we have revealed to you as we revealed to noah and to the prophets after him and we revealed to prophets abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the tribes jesus job jonah aaron and solomon and we gave to david the psalms
4164 and messengers of whom we have narrated to you before and messengers of whom we did not narrate to you certainly allah talked to moses
4165 messengers bearing glad tidings and warning so that the people will have no argument against allah after the messengers allah is the almighty the wise
4166 but allah bears witness for that which he has sent down to you he has sent it down with his knowledge and the angels bear witness it is sufficient that allah is the witness
4167 those who disbelieve and bar from the way of allah have strayed into far error
4168 surely those who disbelieve and have done harm allah would not forgive them neither guide them to a path
4169 except the road to gehenna there they are eternal and for allah that is an easy matter
4170 o people the messenger prophet muhammad has come to you with the truth from your lord so believe it is better for you if you disbelieve to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and allah is the knower the wise
4171 people of the book do not exaggerate your religion do not say about allah except the truth indeed the messiah jesus son of mary is only a messenger and prophet of allah and his word be which he gave to mary and a created spirit by him so believe in allah and his messengers and do not say trinity refrain it is better for you allah is only one god exaltations to him that he should have son to him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth it is sufficient that allah is the guardian
4172 the messiah would not despise being a worshiper of allah nor would the angels who are near whosoever despises worshipping him and becomes proud he will surely assemble them all to him
4173 as for those who believe and did good deeds he will pay them in full their wages and he will increase them from his bounty as for those who despise and became proud he will punish them with a painful punishment and they will find neither a guide nor a helper for themselves other than allah
4174 o people a proof has come to you from your lord and we have sent down to you a clear light
4175 those who believe in allah and hold fast to him he will surely admit them to a mercy and bounty from him and he will guide them to him on a straight path
4176 they will ask you for a verdict say allah rules for you concerning the indirect heir alkalalah which is if a person dies having no children but he has a sister she shall receive half of what he leaves and he is her heir if she has no children if there are two sisters they shall receive twothirds of what he leaves if there are siblings men and women for a male like the share of two females allah clarifies to you lest you go astray allah is knowledgeable of everything
51 believers fulfill your obligations it is lawful for you to eat the flesh of the beast among cattle other than that which is recited to you hunting is forbidden while you are on pilgrimage allah decrees what he will
52 believers do not violate the rites of allah or the sacred month or the offerings or those hung with necklaces nor those whose aim is to the sacred house seeking from their lord bounty and pleasure once your pilgrimage has ended you are free to hunt do not allow your hatred for a nation who would bar you from the holy mosque to lead you to transgress and cooperate in righteousness and warding off evil and do not cooperate in sinfulness and transgression have fear of allah for allah is stern in retribution
53 you are forbidden to consume the dead blood and the flesh of swine also flesh dedicated to any other than allah the flesh of strangled animals and of those beaten that which is killed by falling gored to death mangled by beasts of prey unless you find it still alive and slaughter it also of animals sacrificed on stones to idols you are forbidden to seek division by the arrows that is debauchery those who disbelieve have this day despaired of your religion do not fear them but fear me this day i have perfected your religion for you and completed my favor to you i have approved islam to be your religion as for he who does not intend to commit a sin but is constrained by hunger to eat of what is forbidden then surely allah is forgiving merciful
54 they ask you what is lawful to them say the good things are lawful to you as well as that which you have taught the birds and beasts of prey to catch teaching them of what allah has taught you eat of what they catch for you pronouncing upon it the name of allah and fear allah allah is swift at reckoning
55 the good things have this day been made lawful to you the food of those to whom the book was given is lawful to you and your food is lawful to them lawful to you in marriage are the free believing women and the free women from among those who were given the book before you provided that you give them their dowries in marriage neither committing fornication nor taking them as mistresses whosoever denies the belief his labors will be annulled in the everlasting life he is of the losers
56 believers when you rise to pray wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbow and wipe your heads and wash your feet to the ankle if you are in a state of impurity cleanse yourselves but if you are sick or traveling or if when you have just relieved yourselves or had intercourse with women and you cannot find water touch the clean surface of the earth and rub your hands and faces with it allah does not wish to burden you he seeks only to purify you and to complete his favor to you in order that you may thank
57 remember the favor of allah upon you and the covenant with which he bound you when you said we hear and obey have fear of allah allah is the knower of the innermost of the chests
58 believers be dutiful to allah and bearers of just witness do not allow your hatred for other people to turn you away from justice deal justly it is nearer to piety have fear of allah allah is aware of what you do
59 allah has promised those who believe and do good works forgiveness and a great reward
510 as for those who disbelieve and belie our verses they shall become the companions of hell
511 believers remember the favor which allah bestowed upon you when certain people were about to stretch their hands towards you but he restrained them have fear of allah in allah let the believers put their trust
512 allah made a covenant with the children of israel and raised among them twelve chieftains he said i shall be with you and if you establish the prayers and pay the obligatory charity if you believe in my messengers and assist them and give allah a generous loan i shall forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow whosoever amongst you disbelieves after that he indeed has strayed from the straight path
513 but because they broke their covenant we cursed them and hardened their hearts they changed the words from their places and have forgotten a portion of what they were reminded except for a few you will always find treachery from them yet pardon them and forgive indeed allah loves the gooddoers
514 with those who said they were nazarenes we made a covenant but they have forgotten much of what they were reminded therefore we stirred among them enmity and hatred till the day of resurrection when allah will inform them of all that they have done
515 people of the book our messenger muhammad has come to clarify to you much of what you have hidden of the book and to forgive you much a light has come to you from allah and a clear book
516 with which allah guides those who seek his pleasure to the paths of peace by his permission he takes them out from darkness to the light and guides them to a straight path
517 those who say that allah is the messiah son of mary are indeed those who disbelieved say who then could prevent any thing from allah if he willed to destroy the messiah son of mary together with his mother and all the people of the earth for allah is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them he creates what he will and has power over all things
518 the jews and the nazarenes say we are the children of allah and his loved ones say why then does he punish you for your sins surely you are mortals amongst what he created he forgives whom he will and punishes whom he will for allah is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them all shall return to him
519 people of the book after an interval during which there were no messengers our messenger muhammad has come to clarify your religion to you lest you should say no bearer of glad tidings or a warner has come to us indeed there has come to you a bearer of glad tidings and a warner allah has power over all things
520 remember when moses said to his people remember my people the favors which allah has bestowed upon you he has raised up prophets among you made you kings and given you that which he has not given to any one of the worlds
521 enter my people the holy land which allah has written for you do not turn back in your footsteps lest you shall turn to be losers
522 moses they replied therein is a nation of giants we will not enter until they depart from it if they depart from it only then shall we enter
523 thereupon two pious men whom allah had favored said go in to them through the gate and if you enter you shall surely be victorious in allah put your trust if you are believers
524 they said moses we will never go in so long as they are in it go you and your lord to fight we will stay here
525 he said lord i have none but myself and my brother set a barrier between us and the wicked people
526 he said they shall be forbidden this land for forty years during which time they shall wander homeless on the earth do not grieve for these wicked people
527 recite to them in all truth the news of adams two sons how they each made an offering and how the offering of the one was accepted while that of the other was not he said i will surely kill you the other said allah accepts only from the righteous
528 if you stretch your hand to kill me i shall not stretch mine to kill you for i fear allah the lord of the worlds
529 i would rather you bear my sin and your sin and become among the inhabitants of hell such is the recompense of the harmdoers
530 his soul made it seem fair to him to slay his brother he killed him and became one of the lost
531 then allah sent down a crow which dug the earth to show him how to bury the naked corpse of his brother alas he said am i unable to be like this crow and so i bury my brothers naked corpse and he became among those who regret
532 that was why we wrote for the children of israel that who ever killed a soul except for a soul slain or for sedition in the earth it should be considered as though he had killed all mankind and that who ever saved it should be regarded as though he had saved all mankind our messengers brought them proofs then many of them thereafter commit excesses in the earth
533 the recompense of those who make war against allah and his messenger and spread corruption in the land is that they are to be killed or crucified or have their hand and a foot cut off on opposite sides or be expelled from the land for them is shame in this world and a great punishment in the everlasting life
534 except those who repent before you have power over them for you must know that allah is forgiving the most merciful
535 believers have fear of allah and seek the means by which you come to him struggle in his way in order that you are prosperous
536 as for those who disbelieve if they possessed all that the earth contains and as much besides to ransom themselves from the punishment of the day of resurrection it shall not be accepted from them theirs shall be a painful punishment
537 they will wish to get out of the fire but they shall not theirs shall be a lasting punishment
538 as for the man or woman who is guilty of theft recompense them by cutting off their hands for their crimes that is the punishment from allah allah is mighty wise
539 but whoever repents and mends his ways after committing evil shall be pardoned by allah allah is forgiving most merciful
540 do you not know that to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth he punishes whom he will and forgives whom he will allah has power over all things
541 o messenger do not grieve for those who race into disbelief those who say with their mouth we believe yet their hearts did not believe and the jews who listen to lies and listen to other nations who have not come to you they pervert the words in their places and say if you are given this accept it if not then beware whomsoever allah wishes to try you will not own anything with allah concerning him for those whose hearts allah does not will to purify shall be disgrace in this world and a grievous punishment in the everlasting life
542 they are listeners to lies and devourers of the unlawful if they come to you judge between them or turn away from them if you avoid them they cannot harm you in anything but if you judge judge between them with fairness allah loves the just
543 but how will they come to you for judgment when they already have the torah in which is the judgement of allah then they turn away after that those are not believers
544 we have sent down the torah in which there is guidance and light by which the submissive prophets judged the jews as did the rabbis and those of their lord guarding what they were required to of the book of allah and for which they were witness do not fear people but fear me and do not take a small price for my verses those who do not judge with what allah has sent down are the unbelievers
545 we have written for them a life for a life an eye for an eye a nose for a nose an ear for an ear a tooth for a tooth and for wounds equal retaliation but whosoever forgoes it as a freewill offering it will be an expiation for him whoever does not judge according to what allah has sent down are the harmdoers
546 and we sent following in their footsteps prophet jesus the son of mary confirming that which was before him in the torah and gave him the gospel in which there is guidance and light confirming that which was before him in the torah a guide and an admonition to the cautious
547 therefore let the people of gospel judge in accordance with that which allah has sent in it those who do not judge according to that which allah has sent down are the evildoers
548 and to you we have revealed the book with the truth confirming the book that was revealed before it and a guardian over it therefore give judgment among them in accordance to what allah has sent down and do not yield to their fancies from the truth that has come to you we have ordained a law and a path for each of you had allah willed he could have made you one nation but that he might try you by that which he has bestowed upon you race with one another in good works to allah you shall all return and he will declare to you what you were at variance
549 and judge among them in accordance to that which allah has sent down and do not be led by their desires take heed lest they should turn you away from a part of that which allah has sent to you if they reject your judgment know that allah wants to scourge them for some of their sins many of the people are wrongdoers
550 is it pagan laws that they wish to be judged by who is a better judge than allah for a nation whose belief is firm
551 believers take neither jews nor nazarenes for your guides they are guides of one another whosoever of you takes them for a guide shall become one of their number allah does not guide the wrongdoers
552 you see those in whose hearts is sickness racing with one another to come to them they say we fear lest a change of fortune should befall us may allah bring victory or make known his ordinance then they shall regret what they had hidden in themselves
553 then the believers will say are those the ones who solemnly swore by allah that they would stand by you their works will be annulled and they shall be the losers
554 believers whosoever of you turns from his religion allah will bring a nation whom he loves and they love him humble towards the believers and stern towards the unbelievers striving for the path of allah and fearless of anyones blame such is the bounty of allah he bestows it on whom he will he is the embracer the knower
555 your guide is only allah his messenger and the believers those who establish the prayer pay their obligatory charity and bow down in worship
556 whosoever takes allah for a guide his messenger and the believers the party of allah is the victor
557 believers do not take as guides those who were given the book before you who have made of your religion a jest and a pastime nor the unbelievers have fear of allah if you are believers
558 when you call to prayer they treat it as a jest and a pastime that is because they are a people who have no understanding
559 say people of the book do you blame us for any reason other than that we believe in allah and in what has been sent down to us and what was sent down before us and that most of you are evildoers
560 say shall i tell you who will receive a worse recompense from allah than that those whom allah has cursed and with whom he is angry and made some of them apes and swine and those who worship the devil the place of these is worse and they have strayed further from the right path
561 when they came to you they said we are believers indeed they have entered with disbelief and so they have departed with it allah knows best what they conceal
562 you see many of them race with one another in sin and transgression and devour the unlawful evil is what they do
563 do those of the lord and the rabbis not forbid them to speak sinfully and to devour what is unlawful evil indeed is what they were doing
564 the jews say the hand of allah is chained their own hands are chained and they are cursed for what they said rather his hands are both outstretched he spends as he will that which allah has sent down to you will surely increase the tyranny and disbelief of many of them we have stirred among them enmity and hatred up until the day of resurrection whenever they kindle the fire of war allah extinguishes it they spread corruption in the land and allah does not love those who corrupt
565 if the people of the book had believed and kept from evil we would pardon them their sins and admit them to the gardens of delight
566 if they had established the torah and the gospel and what was sent down to them from their lord they would be eating from above them and from beneath their feet some of them are a righteous nation but many of them evil is what they do
567 o messenger deliver what is sent down to you from your lord if you do not you will not have conveyed his message allah protects you from the people allah does not guide the nation the unbelievers
568 say people of the book you are not upon anything until you establish the torah and the gospel and that which is sent down to you from your lord and that which is sent down to you prophet muhammad from your lord will surely increase the tyranny and disbelief of many of them but do not grieve for the unbelieving nation
569 those who believe jews sabaeans and nazarenes whoever believes in allah and the last day and does good shall neither fear nor shall they sorrow as long as they do not reject any of the prophets
570 we took a covenant with the children of israel and sent forth messengers to them but whenever a messenger came to them with that which did not suit their fancies they belied some and killed others
571 they thought there would be no trial so they were blind and deaf then allah turned towards them then again many of them were blind and deaf and allah is the seer of what they do
572 the unbelievers are those who say allah is the messiah the son of mary but the messiah said children of israel worship allah my lord and your lord he who associates anything with allah allah has indeed forbidden paradise to him and his abode shall be in the fire the harmdoers shall have no helpers
573 indeed those who say allah is the third of the trinity became unbelievers there is but one god if they do not desist in what they say a painful punishment will afflict those of them that disbelieve
574 will they not turn to allah in repentance and ask his forgiveness he is forgiving merciful
575 the messiah the son of mary was not except a messenger other messengers had gone before him his mother was in the state of sincerity they both ate food see how we make plain to them our signs then see how perverted they are
576 say will you worship instead of allah that which owns neither harm nor benefit for you allah is the hearer knower
577 say people of the book do not exaggerate your religion other than the truth and do not follow the desires of a people who went astray before and led many astray and once again have gone astray from the straight path
578 those who disbelieved of the children of israel were cursed by the tongue of prophets david and jesus the son of mary because they disobeyed and transgressed
579 they did not forbid one another from the wrongdoing they were committing evil is what they were doing
580 you see many of them taking the unbelievers as guides evil is that to which their souls forwarded them that allah is angered against them and in the punishment they shall live for ever
581 had they believed in allah and the prophet muhammad and that which is sent down to him they would not have taken them as guides but many of them are evildoers
582 you will find that the most people in enmity to the believers are the jews and idolaters and that the nearest in affection to the believers are those who say we are nazarenes that is because amongst them there are priests and monks and because they are not proud
583 when they listen to that which was sent down to the messenger you will see their eyes fill with tears as they recognize its truth they say lord we believe write us among the witnesses
584 why should we not believe in allah and in the truth that has come down to us why should we not hope for admission among the righteous
585 for their words allah has rewarded them with gardens underneath which rivers flow where they shall live for ever such is the recompense of the righteous
586 but those who disbelieve and belie our verses shall be the companions of hell
587 believers do not forbid the good things that allah has made lawful to you do not transgress allah does not love the transgressors
588 eat of the lawful and good things with which allah has provided you have fear of allah in whom you believe
589 allah will not take you to account for a slip in your oaths but he will take you to account for the oaths which you solemnly swear its expiation is the feeding of ten needy people with such food as you normally offer to your own people or the clothing of them or the freeing of a slave he who does not have must fast three days that is the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn but keep your oaths allah makes plain to you his verses in order that you are thankful
590 believers wine and gambling idols and divining arrows are abominations from the work of satan avoid them in order that you prosper
591 satan seeks to stir up enmity and hatred among you by means of wine and gambling and to bar you from the remembrance of allah and from praying will you not abstain from them
592 obey allah and obey the messenger beware if you give no heed know that our messengers duty is only to give the clear delivery
593 no blame shall be attached to those who believe and did good works in regard to any food they have eaten so long as they ward off the forbidden and believe and do good deeds then they fear and believe and again so long as they fear and do fine deeds allah loves the generous
594 believers allah will test you by means of some hunting which you can catch with your hands and with your spears in order that allah knows those who fear him in private for he who transgresses thereafter shall be a painful punishment
595 o believers do not kill the hunted while you are in pilgrim sanctity whosoever of you kills it willfully there shall be a recompense the like of what he has slain from cattle as shall be judged by two just men among you an offering to reach the kabah or expiation food for needy persons or the equivalent of that in fasting so that he may taste the weight of the recompense of his action allah has pardoned what is past but whoever offends again allah will take vengeance on him allah is the almighty owner of vengeance
596 made lawful to you is the fished of the sea and its food an enjoyment for you and for travelers but you are forbidden the hunted of the land whilst you are on pilgrimage have fear of allah before whom you shall all be assembled
597 allah has made the kabah the sacred house as an establishment for people and the sacred month and the offering and the necklaces in order that you know that allah has knowledge of all that is in the heavens and the earth and that allah has knowledge of all things
598 know that allah is stern in retribution and that allah is the forgiver and the most merciful
599 the duty of the messenger is only the delivery of the message allah knows what you reveal and what you hide
5100 say the evil and the good are not alike even if the abundance of evil pleases you have fear of allah you who are possessed of minds in order that you prosper
5101 believers do not ask about things that if they appeared to you would only upset you but if you ask about them when the koran is being sent down they shall be made plain to you allah will pardon it allah is forgiving clement
5102 a nation asked about them before you and with it they became unbelievers
5103 allah has not made cattle a slit eared shecamel nor a freely grazing shecamel nor a shecamel that bore twins nor an uncastrated camel dedicated to idols but those who disbelieve invent lies against allah most of them do not understand
5104 when it is said to them come to that which allah has sent down and to the messenger they reply sufficient for us is what we have found our fathers upon even though their fathers knew nothing and were not guided
5105 believers look after your own souls he who goes astray cannot harm you if you are guided you shall all return to allah and he will inform you of what you have done
5106 believers if you are traveling in the land and the affliction of death befalls you at the bequeathing testimony shall be two just men from among you or two others from other than you you shall detain both after the prayer and they shall swear by allah if you are doubtful we will not sell it for a price even though it were a near kinsmen nor will we hide the testimony of allah because then we would surely be among the sinful
5107 but if it is discovered that both of them have been subject to sinning then two others shall stand in their place these being the nearest of those most concerned and they shall swear by allah our testimony is truer than their testimony and we have not transgressed because then we would surely be among the harmdoers
5108 so it is likelier that they will bear testimony in proper form or else they will be afraid that oaths may be rejected after their oaths fear allah and listen allah does not guide the people of the evildoers
5109 on a day allah will gather all the messengers and ask them how were you answered they will reply we have no knowledge you are the knower of the unseen
5110 when allah said prophet jesus son of mary remember the favor upon you and on your mother how i strengthened you with the holy spirit gabriel to speak to people in your cradle and of age when he descends and dies how i taught you the book and wisdom the torah and the gospel and how by my permission you fashioned from clay the likeness of a bird and breathed into it so that by my permission it became a living bird how by my permission you healed the blind man and the leper and by my permission you brought the dead forth and how i protected you from the children of israel when you brought them clear signs whereupon the unbelievers among them said this is nothing but plain magic
5111 when i revealed to the disciples to believe in me and in my messenger they replied we believe bear witness that we submit
5112 when the disciples said o prophet jesus son of mary can your lord send down to us a table from heaven he replied have fear of allah if you are believers
5113 we wish to eat of it they said so that we can satisfy our hearts and know that what you said to us is true and that we become witnesses to it
5114 allah our lord said prophet jesus the son of mary send down upon us a table out of heaven that shall be a festival for us the first and the last of us and a sign from you and provide for us you are the best of providers
5115 allah replied i am sending it to you but whoever of you disbelieves thereafter i shall punish him with a punishment that i do not punish anyone from the worlds
5116 and when allah said prophet jesus son of mary did you ever say to the people take me and my mother for two gods other than allah exaltations to you he said how could i say that to which i have no right if i had said that you would have surely known you know what is in my self but i do not know what is in yours indeed you are the knowledgeable of the unseen
5117 i spoke to them of nothing except that which you ordered me that you worship allah my lord and our lord i witnessed them whilst living in their midst and ever since you took me to you you have been the watcher over them you are the witness of everything
5118 if you punish them for their disbelief they surely are your subjects and if you forgive them surely you are the almighty the wise
5119 allah will say this is the day the truthful shall benefit by their truthfulness they shall live for ever in gardens underneath which rivers flow allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with him that is the great winning
5120 to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is in them he has power over all things
61 praise is due to allah who has created the heavens and the earth and made darkness and light yet the unbelievers make others equal with their lord
62 it is he who has created you from clay he has decreed a term for you and another one set with him yet you are still in doubt
63 he is allah in the heavens and earth he has knowledge of all that you hide and all that you reveal he knows what you earn
64 yet every time a sign comes to them from the signs of their lord they turn away from it
65 they belied the truth when it came to them but there shall come to them news of that they were mocking
66 have they not seen how many generations we have destroyed before them whom we had established in the land in a way we never established you sending down for them abundant water from the sky and made the rivers to flow underneath them yet because they sinned we destroyed them and raised up other generations after them
67 had we sent down to you a book on parchment and they touched it with their own hands those who disbelieved would say this is nothing but plain magic
68 they ask why has no angel been sent down to him if we had sent down an angel their fate would have been determined and they would never have been respited
69 if we had made him an angel we would have given him the resemblance of a man and would have as such confused them with that in which they are already confused
610 other messengers have been mocked before you but those who scoffed at them were encompassed by that they had mocked
611 say travel the land and see what was the fate of those who belied
612 say to whom belongs that which is in the heavens and the earth say to allah he has written for himself mercy and will gather you on the day ofresurrection in which there is no doubt those who have lost their souls they do not believe
613 his is whatever is at rest in the night and in the day he is the hearing the knowing
614 say should i take any but allah for a guardian he is the originator of the heavens and the earth he feeds and is not fed say i was commanded to be the first to submit to him do not be one of the idolaters
615 say indeed i fear if i should disobey my lord the punishment of a great day
616 from whomsoever it is averted on that day he will have mercy on him that is a clear triumph
617 if allah visits you with affliction none can remove it except he and if he touches you with good indeed he has power over all things
618 he is the conqueror over his worshipers he is the wise the aware
619 say what thing is greatest in testimony say allah is a witness between me and you this koran has been revealed to me in order that i can warn you and all whom it reaches do you indeed testify that there are gods other than allah say i do not testify say he is only one god and i am quit of that which you associate
620 those to whom we have given the book know him prophet muhammad as they know their own children but those who have lost their own souls do not believe
621 who is more wicked than he who invents a lie about allah or belies his verses the harmdoers shall never prosper
622 on the day when we gather them all together we shall say to the idolaters where are your partners now those whom you claimed
623 then it was not their trial but they will say by allah our lord we have never been idolaters
624 look how they lie against themselves and how that which they were forging has gone astray from them
625 some of them listen to you but we have cast veils over their hearts lest they understand it and in their ears heaviness and if they see every sign they do not believe in it when they come to you they argue the unbelievers say this is nothing but the tales of the ancient ones
626 they forbid from it the koran and keep away from it they destroy none except themselves though they do not sense it
627 if you could see them when they are set before the fire they will say would that we could return then we would not belie the verses of our lord and would be believers
628 indeed that which they concealed will appear to them but if they were sent back they would return to that which they have been forbidden they are indeed liars
629 they say there is only but our present life we shall not be resurrected
630 if you could see them when they are made to stand before their lord he will say is this not the truth yes by our lord they will reply and he will say taste then the punishment for that which you disbelieved
631 they are lost indeed those who belied the meeting with allah when the hour overtakes them suddenly they will say alas for us that we neglected it on their backs they shall be bearing their sinful loads how evil is what they sin
632 the life of this world is but playing and an amusement surely the everlasting home is better for the cautious will you not understand
633 we know what they say saddens you it is not you that they belie but the harmdoers deny the verses of allah
634 messengers indeed were belied before you yet they became patient with that which they were belied and were hurt until our help came to them there is none to alter the words of allah and there has already come to you some news of the messengers
635 if their turning away is hard upon you seek if you can a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the sky by which you can bring them a sign had allah willed he would gather them to guidance do not then be among the ignorant
636 those who listen will surely answer as for the dead allah will revive them to him they shall return
637 they ask why has no sign been sent down to him from his lord say allah is able to send down a sign but most of them do not know
638 there is no crawling creature on the earth nor a bird that flies with its two wings but they are nations like you we have neglected nothing in the book they shall all be gathered before their lord
639 those who belie our verses are deaf and dumb in darkness allah leaves in error whom he will and guides to the straight path whom he pleases
640 say do you see yourselves when the punishment of allah smites you or the hour overtakes you will you call on any except allah if you are truthful
641 no on him alone you will call and he will remove that for which you call upon him if he will then you will forget what you associate with him
642 before you we sent forth to other nations and then seized them with misery and hardship so that they might humble themselves
643 if only they humbled themselves when our scourge overtook them but their hearts were hardened and satan decorated to them what they were doing
644 and when they had forgotten that with which they have been admonished we opened the gates of everything to them until just as they were rejoicing in what they were given we suddenly seized them and they were in utter despair
645 as such the harmdoers were annihilated praise be to allah lord of the worlds
646 say what would you see if allah took away your hearing and your sight and set a seal upon your hearts who is a god other than allah to bring it back to you look how we make plain to them our verses and yet they turn away
647 say what do you see yourselves then if the punishment of allah overtook you suddenly or openly would any perish but the harmdoing nation
648 we send forth our messengers only to give glad tidings to mankind and to warn them those who believe and mend their ways shall have nothing to fear or to be saddened
649 but those who belie our verses punishment shall touch them for their misdeeds
650 say i do not tell you that i have the treasuries of allah or know the unseen nor do i claim to be an angel i follow only that which is revealed to me say are the blind and the seeing alike will you not think
651 and warn with it those who fear to be brought before their lord that they have no guardian or intercessor other than allah in order that they are cautious
652 do not drive away those who call on their lord morning and evening seeking only his face nothing of their account falls upon you and nothing of your account falls upon them that you should drive them away and so become one of the harmdoers
653 as such we have made some of them a means for testing others so that they should say are those whom allah favors amongst us but does not allah best know the thankful
654 when those who believe in our verses come to you say peace be upon you your lord has decreed mercy on himself if any one of you commits evil through ignorance and then repents and mends his ways then he is forgiving the most merciful
655 as such we make plain our verses so that the path of the wicked will be clear
656 say i am forbidden to worship whom you call upon instead of allah say i will not yield to your wishes for then i should have strayed and should not be of those guided
657 say i am upon a clear proof from my lord yet you belie him i do not have that which you seek to hasten judgement is for allah alone he narrates the truth and he is the best of deciders
658 say if what you seek to hasten were with me the matter between you and me would be decided and allah knows very well the harmdoers
659 with him are the keys of the unseen none knows them but he he knows that which is in the land and sea no leaf falls except he knows it and there is no grain in the darkness of the earth fresh or withered but is recorded in a clear book
660 it is he who makes you to die by night knowing what you have gained by day and then resurrects you so that an ordained term is realized to him you shall return and he will tell you of what you have been doing
661 he is the conqueror over his worshipers he sends forth guardians who watch over you until death comes to one of you when our messengers take him and they are not neglectful
662 then they are returned to allah their guardian the true surely the judgement is for him he is the swiftest of reckoners
663 say who saves you from the darkness of the land and sea when you call out to him humbly and in secret saying if you save us from this we will be among the thankful
664 say allah saves you from them and from all afflictions then you associate with him
665 say he is able to send forth upon you punishment from above you or beneath your feet or to divide you into discordant factions and to make some of you taste the affliction of the other look how we make plain our verses in order that they understand
666 your nation has belied it the koran although it is the truth say i am not a guardian over you
667 every news has its appointed time you will surely know
668 when you see those who plunge scoffing into our verses withdraw from them till they plunge into some other talk if satan causes you to forget leave the wrongdoing people as soon as you remember
669 those who are cautious are not accountable for them in anything but it is a reminder in order that they be cautious
670 avoid those who take their religion as playing and an amusement and are seduced by the life of this world admonish them hereby lest a soul be taken by what it has gained for it has no guardian or intercessor before allah and though it offers every ransom it shall not be taken from it those are they who are taken for that which they earned for them a drink of boiling water a stern punishment for their disbelief
671 say are we to call other than allah what can neither help nor harm us are we to turn on our heels after allah has guided us like him who being bewitched by devils blunders aimlessly in the earth although his friends call him to the guidance saying come to us say the guidance of allah is the guidance we are commanded to submit to the lord of the worlds
672 and to establish prayer and fear him before him you shall all be assembled
673 it was he who created the heavens and the earth in truth on the day when he says be it shall be his word is the truth his shall be the kingdom on the day when the horn is blown the knower of the unseen and the visible and he is the wise the aware
674 and remember when abraham said to his father azar will you take idols for gods surely i see you and your people are in clear error
675 and so we showed abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth so that he might be of those who are certain
676 when night drew over him he saw a planet this he said is surely my lord but when it set he said i do not like the setting ones
677 when he saw the rising moon he said this is my lord but when it set he said if my lord does not guide me i shall surely be amongst the astray nation
678 then when he saw the sun rise shining he said this must be my lord it is larger but when it set he said o nation i am quit of what you associate with allah the creator
679 i have turned my face to him who has created the heavens and the earth uprightly and i am not among the idolaters
680 his nation argued with him he said will you argue with me about allah indeed he guided me except by his will i do not fear those you associate with him my lord embraces all things in knowledge will you not remember
681 and how should i fear what you have associated when you yourselves are not afraid that you have associated with allah that which he did not send down for it upon you an authority which of the two parties is more deserving of safety if you know
682 those who believe and have not confounded their belief with harm security belongs to them and they are guided
683 such is the argument that we gave abraham against his nation we raise whom we will to an exalted rank your lord is wise knowing
684 we gave him isaac and jacob and guided both and we guided noah before them among his descendants were david and solomon job joseph moses and aaron as such we recompense the gooddoers
685 and prophets zachariah john jesus and elias each was of the righteous
686 and ishmael elisha jonah and lot each we preferred above the worlds
687 as we did their fathers their descendants and their brothers we chose them and guided them to a straight path
688 such is the guidance of allah by it he guides whom he will of his worshipers had they associated others with him their labors would have indeed been annulled
689 those we have given them the book judgment and prophethood if these disbelieve it we have entrusted it to others who do not disbelieve in it
690 those were whom allah guided follow then their guidance and say i do not ask you a wage for it surely it is a reminder to the worlds
691 they have not valued allah with his true value when they said allah has never sent down anything to a mortal say who then sent down the book which moses brought a light and guidance for people you put it on to parchments revealing them and hiding much you have now been taught what neither you nor your fathers knew before say allah then leave them playing in their plunging
692 and this is a blessed book which we have sent down confirming what came before it in order that you warn the mother of the villages mecca and those who live around it those who believe in the everlasting life believe in it and preserve their prayers
693 who is more harmful than he who invents a lie about allah or says it has been revealed to me when nothing has been revealed to him or he who says i will send down the like of what allah has sent down would that you could see the harmdoers when death overwhelms them with hands outstretched the angels will say yield up your souls you shall be recompensed with a humiliating punishment this day for you have said of allah what is untrue and you grew proud against his verses
694 now you have returned to us alone as we created you at first leaving behind all that we have bestowed on you nor do we see with you your intercessors those whom you asserted to be your associates the ties which bound you are broken and that which you asserted has gone astray from you
695 it is allah who splits the grain and the datestone he brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living so that is allah how then are you perverted
696 he splits the sky into dawn he has ordained the night for rest and the sun and the moon for reckoning such is the ordinance of the almighty the knowing
697 it is he who has created for you the stars so that you can be guided by them in the darkness of land and sea we have made plain our verses to a nation who know
698 it is he who originated you from one soul then a lodging place and then a repository we have made plain the verses to a nation that understands
699 he sends down water from the sky and with it we bring forth the plant of every thing from these we bring forth green foliage and composite grain palmtrees laden with clusters of dates within reach vineyards and olive groves and pomegranates alike and unlike behold their fruits when they bear fruit and ripen surely in these there are signs for a nation who believe
6100 yet they regard the jinn as the partners of allah although he created them and without knowledge ascribe to him sons and daughters exaltations to him he is above what they describe
6101 he is the creator of the heavens and the earth how can he have a son when he had no female companion he created all things and has knowledge of all things
6102 that is allah your lord there is no god except he the creator of all things therefore worship him he is the guardian of all things
6103 no eye can see him though he sees all eyes he is the subtle the aware
6104 clear proofs have come to you from your lord whosoever sees clearly it is for himself and whosoever is blind it is against himself i am not an overseer for you
6105 as such we make plain our verses so that they can say you have studied in order that we clarify it to a nation that knows
6106 therefore follow what has been revealed to you from your lord there is no god except him and avoid the idolaters
6107 had allah willed they would not have associated we have not made you an overseer for them nor are you their guardian
6108 do not say crude words to those who call upon other than allah lest they use crude words about allah in revenge without knowledge as such we have made the actions of each nation seem pleasing to their lord they shall return and he will inform them of that they were doing
6109 they solemnly swear by allah that if a sign is given to them they would believe in it say signs are only with allah and how can you tell if it comes they will not believe
6110 we will turn away their hearts and eyes since they refused to believe in it at first we will leave them in their insolence wandering blindly
6111 even if we sent down the angels to them and the dead spoke to them and assembled all things in front of them they would still not believe unless allah willed it but most of them are ignorant
6112 as such we have assigned for every prophet an enemy the satans of humans and jinn revealing varnished speech to each other all as a delusion but had your lord willed they would not have done so therefore leave them and what they invent
6113 so that the hearts of those who have no belief in the everlasting life are inclined to it and being pleased persist in their sinful ways
6114 should i seek a judge other than allah when it is he who has sent down the well distinguished book for you those to whom we have given the book know that it is the truth sent down from your lord so do not be among the doubters
6115 perfected are the words of your lord in truth and justice none can change his words he is the hearing the knowing
6116 if you obeyed most of those on earth they would lead you astray from the path of allah they follow only supposition and they are but conjecturing
6117 your lord knows best who stray from his path and the guided
6118 eat then of that over which the name of allah has been mentioned when slaughtered if you truly believe in his verses
6119 and why should you not eat of that over which the name of allah has been pronounced when he has already made plain to you what is forbidden except when you are constrained many are those who mislead through ignorance on account of their fancies but your lord best knows the transgressors
6120 forsake the revealed and hidden sin those who earn sin shall be recompensed for what they have committed
6121 do not eat from that which the name of allah has not been mentioned for it is a sin the satans will reveal to their guided ones to argue with you if you obey them you shall indeed become idolaters
6122 is he who was dead whom we have revived and given a light with which he walks among people to be compared to him who blunders about in darkness from which he will never emerge as such what the unbelievers have done appear decorated to them
6123 and as such we have placed in every village its archtransgressors to scheme there but they scheme only against themselves though they do not sense it
6124 when a sign came to them they said we will not believe in it unless we are given that which the messengers of allah have been given but allah knows best where to place his message humiliation with allah shall befall the sinners as well as a terrible punishment for what they devised
6125 whomsoever allah desires to guide he expands his chest to islam submission whomsoever he desires to lead astray he makes his chest narrow tight as though he were climbing to heaven as such allah lays the scourge on the unbelievers
6126 this is the path of your lord a straight path we have made plain our verses to a nation who remember
6127 theirs is the abode of peace with their lord he is their guardian for what they did
6128 on the day when he assembles them all together o company of jinn you have seduced mankind in great numbers and their guided ones among the humans will say lord we have enjoyed each other but now we have reached the term which you have appointed for us he will say the fire shall be your lodging and there you shall remain for ever except as allah will your lord is wise knowing
6129 so we make the harmdoers guides of each other for what they have earned
6130 jinn and human did there not come to you messengers of your own who narrated to you my verses and warned you of encountering this day they will reply we bear witness against ourselves indeed the life of this world beguiled them they will bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers
6131 that is because your lord will not destroy villages unjustly while their inhabitants were inattentive
6132 they all have their degrees according to their deeds your lord is not inattentive of their actions
6133 your lord is rich and the owner of mercy he can destroy you if he will and replace you with whom he pleases just as he raised you from the offspringof other nations
6134 that which you are promised is sure to come you shall not frustrate me
6135 say work according to your station my people for indeed i am working you shall know to whom will be the good end of the abode the harmdoers shall not be triumphant
6136 they set aside for allah a share of what he has created of tilth and cattle saying this is for allah so they claim and this for our associates gods the share of their associates never reaches allah but the share of allah reaches their associates how evil they judge
6137 as such their associates made it attractive to the idolaters to kill their children so that they ruin them and confuse them about their religion but had allah willed they would not have done so therefore leave them to their false inventions
6138 they say these cattle and these crops are forbidden none can eat of them except those whom we permit so they claim and cattle whose backs are forbidden and others over which they do not pronounce the name of allah as such fabricating lies against him he will recompense them for their invented lies
6139 they also say what is in the bellies wombs of these cattle is reserved for our males but not for our wives but if it is stillborn they all partake of it he will recompense them for their describing he is wise knowing
6140 lost are those who without knowledge have foolishly slain their own children and made unlawful that which allah has provided them fabricating lies about allah they have gone astray and are not guided
6141 he brings forth gardens trellised and untrellised palmtrees and crops different to eat and the olive and pomegranates alike and unlike when it bears fruit eat of it and pay what is due the zakat of it upon the harvest day but do not be wasteful he does not love the wasteful
6142 and of the cattle some are for carrying burdens and others for slaughter eat of that which allah has provided you with and do not follow in satans footsteps he is your open enemy
6143 he has given you eight couples a pair of sheep and a pair of goats say of these has he forbidden you the males the females or what the wombs of the two females contain tell me with knowledge if you are truthful
6144 then a pair of camels and a pair of cattle say of these has he forbidden you the males the females or what the wombs of the two females contain were you witnesses when allah charged you with this who is more harmful than he who without knowledge invents a lie about allah to mislead people allah does not guide the harmdoers
6145 say i find nothing in what has been revealed to me that forbids any one to eat of any food except the dead running blood and the flesh of swine for these are unclean and that which has been hallowed in its slaughter to other than allah but whoever is constrained to eat of any of these not intending to sin or transgress then your lord is forgiving the most merciful
6146 we forbade the jews all with undivided hoofs and the fat of sheep and cattle except what is on their backs and entrails and what is mixed with their bones as such we recompensed them for their transgress ions indeed we are truthful
6147 if they belie you say your lord is the owner of all encompassing mercy but his might cannot be withheld from the nation the evildoers
6148 the idolaters will say had allah willed neither we nor our fathers would have associated idols nor would we have forbidden anything as such those who have gone before them belied until they tasted our might say have you any knowledge you can bring forth to us you follow nothing but guessing and you are only speakers of conjecture
6149 say allah alone has the conclusive proof had he willed he would have guided you all
6150 say bring those witnesses of yours who can testify that allah has forbidden this if they testify to it do not testify with them nor follow the wishes of those who belie our verses and disbelieve in the everlasting life and ascribe equals to their lord
6151 say come i will recite to you what your lord forbids you that you shall associate anything with him that you shall be good to your parents that you shall not kill your children because of poverty we provide for you and for them that you shall not commit foul deeds whether openly or in secret and that you shall not kill the soul that allah has forbidden except by right with such allah charges you in order that you understand
6152 do not touch the wealth of the orphan except in the fairer manner until he reaches maturity give just weight and full measure we never charge a soul with more than it can bear when you speak be just even if it affects your own kinsmen fulfill the covenant of allah with such he charges you in order that you remember
6153 this path of mine is straight follow it and do not follow other paths for they will scatter you away from his path with such allah charges you in order that you be cautious
6154 then to moses we gave the book complete for him who does good and to make plain all things and guidance and mercy so that they might believe in the ultimate meeting with their lord
6155 and we have sent down this blessed book the holy koran follow it and be cautious in order that you receive mercy
6156 lest you should say the book was sent down only to two parties before us we are inattentive to their study
6157 or you say had the book been sent down to us we would have been better guided than they indeed a clear sign has now come to you from your lord a guidance and a mercy and who is more harmful than he who belies the verses of allah and turns away from them we shall recompense those who turn away from our verses with an evil punishment for their turning away
6158 are they waiting for the angels or your lord to come to them or for some of the signs of your lord on the day when some of the signs of your lord come no soul will be benefited by its belief had it not believed before or earned good in its belief say wait we are waiting
6159 you have nothing to do with those who have made divisions in their religion and become sects their affair is with allah and he will inform them of what they have done
6160 he who brings a good deed shall have tenfold of its like but he who brings a sin shall be recompensed only for its like none shall be wronged
6161 say my lord has guided me to a straight path an upright religion the creed of abraham he was upright not from the idolaters
6162 say my prayers and my worship for example pilgrimage and sacrifice my life and my death are all for allah the lord of the worlds
6163 he has no partner with that i am commanded and i am the first of the submitters muslims
6164 say should i seek a lord other than allah who is the lord of all things every soul earns only to its account no soul shall bear anothers burden then to your lord you shall be returned and he will inform you about that in which you differed
6165 it is he who has made you caliphs in the earth and raised some of you in rank above others so that he might try you in what he has given you swift is your lord in retribution yet he is forgiving merciful
71 aliflaammeemsaad
72 the book has been sent down to you so let your chest have no constriction because of it in order to warn thereby and as a reminder to the believers
73 follow that which is sent down to you from your lord and do not follow guardians other than him little do you remember
74 how many a village have we laid in ruin in the night our might fell upon it or at midday when they were drowsy
75 and when our might fell upon them they only said we have indeed been harmdoers
76 we will question those to whom our message was sent as we shall question the messengers
77 with knowledge we will narrate to them for we are never absent
78 on that day the weighing is true he whose scales are heavy those are the prosperers
79 but he whose scales are light those have lost their souls because they were harmful towards our verses
710 we established you in the earth and made for you a livelihood but little is it that you give thanks
711 we created you then we shaped you then we said to the angels prostrate yourselves before adam they all prostrated themselves except iblis he was not among the prostrated
712 he allah asked what prevented you to prostrate when i commanded you i am better than he he replied you created me of fire and you created him of clay
713 he allah said descend from it this is no place for you to be proud begone you are of the humiliated
714 he replied respite me till the day of resurrection
715 said he allah you are among the respited
716 he answered because you have caused me to go astray i will waylay them as they walk on your straight path
717 and come upon them from the front and from the rear from their right and from their left then you shall find most of them ungrateful
718 begone said he despised and outcast as for those of them that follow you i shall fill gehenna hell with all of you
719 o adam dwell with your wife in paradise and eat from whatever you please but never approach this tree or you shall both become harmdoers
720 but satan whispered to them so that he might reveal to them their shameful parts which had been hidden from them he said your lord has prohibited you from this tree lest you both become angels or become among the immortal
721 he swore to both indeed i am to you among the advisers
722 so he cheated both by delusion and when they had tasted the tree their shameful parts became apparent to them and they both covered themselves with the leaves of paradise then their lord called to them saying did i not prohibit you to approach that tree and did i not warn you that satan was your clear enemy
723 both replied lord we have harmed ourselves if you do not forgive us and have mercy on us we shall surely be among the lost
724 he said descend each of you an enemy to each other the earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time
725 he said there you shall live and there you shall die and from there you shall emerge
726 children of adam we have sent down to you clothing that covers your nakedness and feathers but the clothing of piety that is better that is one of the signs of allah in order that they remember
727 children of adam do not let satan tempt you as he brought your parents out of paradise he stripped them of their garments to show them their shameful parts indeed he and his descendants see you from where you cannot see them we have made the satans supporters of those who do not believe
728 when they commit an indecency they say this is what we found our fathers practicing and with it allah has ordered us say allah does not order indecency would you tell of allah what you do not know
729 say my lord ordered justice turn your faces to him in every place of prayer and supplicate to him making the religion sincerely to him as he originated you you shall return
730 some he has guided and upon some justly is the straying for they had chosen the satans for supporters instead of allah and suppose themselves to be guided
731 children of adam take your adornment at every place of prayer eat and drink and do not waste he does not love the wasteful
732 say who has forbidden the adornment that allah has brought for his worshipers and the good provision say they are in this life for those who believe and purely theirs on the day of resurrection as such we distinguish the verses to people who know
733 say my lord has forbidden all indecent acts whether apparent or disguised and sin and unjust insolence and that you associate with allah that for which he has never sent down an authority or to say about allah what you do not know
734 to every nation a term when their term comes they shall not delay it by a single hour nor yet hasten it
735 children of adam when messengers of your own come to narrate to you my verses those who are cautious and mend their ways will have nothing to fear neither shall they be saddened
736 but those who belie and grow proud against our verses shall be the inhabitants of the fire and there they shall remain for ever
737 who is more harmful than he who invents a lie about allah or belies his verses such shall have their share of the book and when our messengers come to take them away they shall say to them where now are those whom you invoked other than allah they have forsaken us they will answer and will bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers
738 he will say enter the fire and join the nations of jinn and humans that have gone before you as they enter every nation will curse its sisternation and when all are gathered in the pit the last of them will say of the first these lord are those who led us astray give them a double punishment of the fire he will answer for each double although you do not know it
739 then the first will say to the last you were no better than us so taste the punishment for what you have earned
740 the gates of heaven shall not be opened for those who have belied and grew proud against our verses nor shall they enter paradise until a camel shall pass through the eye of a needle as such we shall recompense the sinners
741 gehenna hell shall be their cradle and layers of fire shall cover them as such we recompense the harmdoers
742 as for those who believe and do good works we never charge a soul with more than it can bear they are the companions of paradise and there they shall live for ever
743 we shall strip away all rancor from their chests rivers shall flow underneath them and they shall say praise be to allah who has guided us to this had allah not given us guidance we should not have been guided the messengers of our lord surely came with the truth then they are called this is the paradise which you have inherited for what you did
744 then the companions of paradise will call out to the companions of the fire what our lord promised we have found to be true have you too found the promise of your lord to be true yes they shall answer and a caller will announce between them that the curse of allah is upon the harmdoers
745 who have barred others from the path of allah and sought to make it crooked and who had no belief in the everlasting life
746 and between them is a veil and on the ramparts there shall stand men who will know each by their marks to the companions of paradise they shall call peace be upon you yet they did not enter it on account of their eagerness
747 and when they turn their eyes towards the companions of the fire they will say lord do not cast us among the harmdoers
748 and the companions of the ramparts call to men whose marks they recognize neither your amassing nor your pride have availed you
749 are these whom you swore that allah would never have mercy upon them to them it will be said enter paradise you have nothing to fear neither will you be saddened
750 the companions of the fire will call out to the companions of paradise pour upon us some water or some of that which allah has provided you but they shall reply allah has forbidden both to the unbelievers
751 who made their religion an amusement and play and who were beguiled by their worldly life on this day we will forget them as they forgot the meeting of that day for they denied our verses
752 we have brought to them a book which we have made plain based upon knowledge a guidance and a mercy to believers
753 are they waiting but for its fulfillment on the day when it is realized those who have forgotten it will say the messengers of our lord have surely come with the truth have we then any intercessors to intercede for us or shall we be returned to do other than that we have done they have lost their souls and that which they invented will have gone astray from them
754 your lord is allah who in six days created the heavens and the earth and then willed to the throne he throws the veil of night over the day swiftly they follow one another the sun the moon and the stars are compelled to his order his is the creation his is the command blessed is allah the lord of the worlds
755 supplicate to your lord with humility and in secret he does not love the transgressors
756 do not make mischief in the earth after it has been put right pray to him with fear and hope his mercy is near to the righteous
757 he sends forth the winds as carriers of the glad tidings between the hands of his mercy and when they have carried up a heavy cloud we drive it on to some dead land and therewith send down water bringing forth all manner of fruit as such we will raise the dead in order that you remember
758 good land yields its vegetation by the permission of its lord while the corrupted yields only the scanty so we make plain the verses to those who are thankful
759 we sent forth noah to his nation he said worship allah my people for you have no god except he i fear for you the punishment of a great day
760 but the assembly of his nation said we can see that you are in clear error
761 i am not in error my nation he replied i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
762 sent to convey to you the messages of my lord and to advise you for i know from allah what you do not know
763 do you wonder that a remembrance should come to you from your lord to a man from yourselves in order that he may warn you and that you may be cautious so that mercy comes upon you
764 but they belied him so we saved him and those who were with him in the ark and we drowned those who belied our verses surely they were a blind nation
765 and to the people of aad we sent their brother hood he said worship allah my nation for you have no god except he will you not then be cautious
766 the disbelieving assembly of his nation said we see you in foolishness and think that you are of the liars
767 my nation there is no foolishness in me he replied i am a messenger of the lord of the worlds
768 i deliver to you the messages of my lord and i am your honest adviser
769 do you wonder that a remembrance should come to you from your lord to a man from yourselves in order that he may warn you remember that he has made you the heirs of noahs nation and increased you in broad stature remember the favors of allah in order that you prosper
770 they said have you come to us in order that we worship allah alone and renounce that which our fathers worshipped bring down that with which you threaten us if you are from the truthful
771 he answered the punishment and wrath of your lord has already fallen upon you would you dispute with me about names which you and your fathers have invented and for which no authority has been sent down from allah wait if you will i am waiting with you
772 we saved him and all who were with him through our mercy and annihilated those who belied our verses they were not believers
773 and to thamood we sent their brother salih he said worship allah my nation for you have no god except he a clear proof has come to you from your lord here is the shecamel of allah a sign for you leave her to graze in the earth of allah and do not touch her with evil lest a painful punishment seizes you
774 remember that he has made you the successor of aad and lodged you in the land you have built palaces on its plains and hewed out houses in the mountains remember the favor of allah and do not act mischievously in the earth corrupting
775 the proud assembly of his nation said to the weak amongst them who believed do you really believe that salih is sent from his lord they answered we believe in that with which he was sent
776 those who were proud said we disbelieve in that which you believed in
777 then they hamstrung the shecamel and defied the order of their lord saying to salih bring down that which you have promised us if you truly are one of the messengers
778 thereupon the earthquake seized them at morning in their dwellings they were crouched dead
779 he turned from them saying i conveyed to you my nation the message of my lord and gave you counsel but you had no love for sincere advisers
780 and lot who said to his nation do you commit such indecency sodomy in a way that no one has preceded you in the worlds
781 you approach men lustfully instead of women truly you are a nation who exceed in sin
782 the only answer of his nation was expel them from your village they are people who keep themselves purified
783 we saved him and all his family except his wife who was made to remain
784 and we rained down upon them a rain so look how was the end of the evildoers
785 and to midian their brother shuaib he said worship allah my nation for you have no god except he a clear sign has come to you from your lord give just weight and full measure and do not diminish the goods of people do not corrupt the land after it has been set right that is best for you if you are believers
786 do not sit in every road threatening and barring from the path of allah those who believed it nor seek to make it crooked remember how he multiplied you when you were few in number consider the end of the corrupters
787 if there are some among you who believe in that which i have been sent and others who disbelieve it be patient until allah shall judge between us he is the best of judges
788 the proud assembly of his nation said we will expel you shuaib and those who believe with you from our village unless you return to our creed he replied even though we hate it
789 we would have invented lies about allah if we returned to your creed from which allah has saved us it is not for us that we return into it again except if allah our lord wills for our lord has embraced everything with knowledge and in allah we have put our trust our lord open between us and our nation with truth you are the best of openers
790 but the unbelieving assembly of his nation said if you follow shuaib you shall assuredly be losers
791 so the earthquake seized them at the morning they were crouched in their dwellings dead
792 it seemed as if those who had belied shuaib had never lived there those who belied shuaib were the losers
793 he turned away from them saying i conveyed to you my nation the messages of my lord and advised you how can i grieve for the unbelieving nation
794 we sent no prophet to a village but seized its inhabitants with misfortune and adversity in order that they might be humble in supplication
795 then we changed evil for good until they multiplied and said our fathers were indeed touched by misfortune and adversity so we seized them suddenly while they were unaware
796 had the people of the villages believed and been cautious we would have opened upon them the blessings from heaven and earth but they belied and we seized them for what they earned
797 do the inhabitants of the villages feel secure from our might coming to them at night whilst they sleep
798 or do the inhabitants of the villages feel secure from our might coming to them in the midmorning while they play
799 in reply to your devising do they feel secure from the devising of allah none feels secure from the devising of allah except the loosing nation
7100 is it not plain to those who inherit the earth after its inhabitants that if we willed we could smite them for their sins and set a seal upon their hearts so that they do not hear
7101 those villages we narrate their news to you their messengers came to them with clear proofs yet they would not believe what they had belied before as such allah seals the hearts of the unbelievers
7102 we did not find the covenant upheld by the majority of them but we found most of them evildoers
7103 after those we sent forth moses with our signs to pharaoh and his assembly but with it they harmed look at the end of the corrupters
7104 moses said pharaoh i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
7105 incumbent upon me is that i say nothing of allah except the truth i bring you a clear proof from your lord so let the children of israel depart with me
7106 he answered if you have come with a sign show it to us if you are of the truthful
7107 he threw down his staff and it was clearly a serpent
7108 then he drew out his hand and it was luminous to the onlookers
7109 the assembly of pharaohs nation said this man is a wellversed sorcerer
7110 who seeks to drive you from your land what do you command
7111 others said put them off a while he and his brother and send forth to your cities gatherers
7112 to summon every wellversed sorcerer to you
7113 the sorcerers came to pharaoh they said shall we be rewarded if we are the winners
7114 yes he answered and you will be among those near
7115 they said moses will you throw first or shall we be the throwers
7116 throw he replied and when they threw they bewitched the peoples eyes and terrified them and produced great sorcery
7117 then we revealed to moses now throw down your staff and thereupon it swallowed up their false invention
7118 so the truth prevailed and what they were doing was annulled
7119 they were defeated and turned belittled
7120 and the sorcerers prostrated themselves
7121 saying we believe in the lord of the worlds
7122 the lord of moses and aaron
7123 pharaoh said do you believe in him before i permit this is a plot that you have contrived in the city in order to expel its people from it now you shall know
7124 i will cut off on opposite sides a hand and a foot and then crucify you all
7125 they replied we shall surely turn to our lord
7126 you would take revenge on us only because we believed in the signs of our lord when they came to us lord pour patience upon us and let us die as submitters muslims
7127 the assembly of pharaohs nation said will you allow moses and his nation to corrupt in the land and to forsake you and your gods he replied we will put their sons to death and spare their women indeed we are conquerors over them
7128 moses said to his nation seek help from allah and be patient the earth belongs to allah he gives it as a heritage to whom he chooses amongst his worshipers the outcome is for the cautious
7129 they replied we were hurt before you came to us and after you came to us he said your lord may destroy your enemies and make you inheritors in the land then he will see how you conduct yourselves
7130 we seized pharaohs people with years of drought and scarcity of fruit so that they might remember
7131 when good things came their way they said it is our due but when evil befell them they blamed their ill fortune on moses and those with him indeed their ill fortune was with allah though most of them did not know
7132 they said whatever sign you bring to us to cast a spell upon us we will not believe in you
7133 so we sent upon them floods locusts lice frogs and blood all these were clear signs yet they were proud against them for they were wicked people
7134 and when the plague smote them they said moses pray to your lord for us invoking the promise he has made with you if you lift the plague from us we will believe in you and let the children of israel go with you
7135 but when we had lifted the plague from them for a term which they had to reach they broke their promise
7136 so we punished them and drowned them in the sea for they had belied our signs and gave no heed to them
7137 we gave the persecuted nation dominion over the eastern and western lands which we had blessed so the word of your lord the finest was fulfilled for the children of israel because of their patience and we destroyed the edifices and towers of pharaoh and whatsoever they manufactured
7138 and we moved the children of israel from one side of the sea to the other and they came upon a nation zealously devoted to the idols they had they said to moses make a god for us as they have gods moses replied you are indeed an ignorant nation
7139 that which they are engaged upon shall be shattered and all their works are vain
7140 should i seek any god for you except allah he has exalted you above the nations
7141 and that we saved you from pharaohs family who had oppressed you cruelly putting your sons to death and sparing your women surely that was a great trial from your lord
7142 we appointed for moses thirty nights and we completed them with ten more so that the appointment with his lord took forty nights moses said to aaron his brother take my place among my nation do what is right and do not follow the path of the corrupt doers
7143 and when moses came at the appointed time and his lord spoke to him he said lord let me see that i can look at you he replied you shall not see me but look at the mountain if it remains firm in its place then shall you see me and when his lord was revealed to the mountain and caused it to be crushed and leveled whereupon moses fell down senseless and when he recovered he said exaltations to you i repent to you i am the first of believers
7144 he said moses i have chosen you from all mankind with my messages and my words therefore take what i have given you and be among the thankful
7145 we inscribed for him upon the tablets all kinds of exhortation and clear explanations of all things so take it forcefully and order your nation to take what is best of it i shall show you the home of the wicked
7146 from my signs i will turn away the unrightfully arrogant in the land so that even if they witness every sign they would not believe it if they see the path of righteousness they shall not take it as a path but if they see the path of error they shall take it for their path because they belied our signs and were inattentive towards them
7147 vain are the deeds of those who belie our signs and the everlasting life shall they not be recompensed except for what they used to do
7148 in his absence the nation of moses made a calf from their ornaments a body with a hollow sound did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to a path yet they took it in worship and were harmdoers
7149 but when it landed in their hands and saw that they had strayed they said if our lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us we shall be lost
7150 and when moses returned to his nation angry and sorrowful he said evil is what you have done in my absence would you hasten the retribution of your lord he threw down the tablets and seizing his brother by the head dragged him towards him son of my mother said aaron the nation weakened me and almost killed me do not let my enemies rejoice over me do not number me among the harmdoers
7151 lord said moses forgive me and forgive my brother admit us to your mercy for you are most merciful of the merciful
7152 those who worshipped the calf incurred the anger of their lord and abasement in this life and as such we recompense the forgers
7153 as for those who do evil and later repent and believe your lord is forgiving the most merciful thereafter
7154 when his anger abated moses took up the tablets upon which was inscribed guidance and mercy to those who fear their lord
7155 moses chose from among his nation seventy men for our appointment and when the quake seized them moses said my lord had it been your will you would have destroyed them before and me will you destroy us for that which the fools amongst us did it is only your trial by which you leave in error whom you will and guide whom you will you alone are our guardian forgive us and have mercy on us you are the best of those who forgive
7156 write for us what is good in this life and in the everlasting life to you alone we turn he replied i will smite with my punishment whom i will yet my mercy embraces all things i will write it my mercy to those who are cautious give the obligatory charity and believe in our verses
7157 and to those who shall follow the messenger the unlettered prophet muhammad whom they shall find written with them in the torah and the gospel he will order kindness upon them and forbid them to do evil he will make good things lawful to them and prohibit all that is foul he will relieve them of their burdens and of the shackles that weigh upon them those who believe in him and honor him those who aid him and follow the light sent forth with him shall surely prosper
7158 say o mankind i am the messenger of allah to you all his is the kingdom in the heavens and the earth there is no god except he he revives and causes to die therefore believe in allah and his messenger the unlettered prophet who believes in allah and his words follow him in order that you are guided
7159 yet among the people of moses there was a nation who preached the truth and acted justly
7160 we divided them into twelve tribes each a nation and when his people demanded drink we revealed to moses strike the rock with your staff thereupon twelve springs gushed from the rock and each tribe knew its drinkingplace we caused the clouds to cast their shadow over them and sent down for them manna and quails saying eat of the good things we have provided for you indeed they did us no wrong but they wronged themselves
7161 when it was said to them dwell in this village and eat of whatever you please and say unburdening and enter the gate prostrating we will forgive you your sins and increase the gooddoers
7162 the wicked amongst them changed what was said for other words therefore we sent down upon them from heaven a punishment for their evil doing
7163 ask them about the village that overlooked the sea and what befell its people when they broke the sabbath each sabbath their fish came swimming towards the shore but on other days they did not come to them as such we tempted them the people because they had done wrong
7164 and when some asked why do you admonish a nation whom allah will destroy or sternly punish they replied seeking a pardon from your lord and in order that they may be cautious
7165 therefore when they forgot that of which they were reminded we saved those who were forbidding evil and seized the evildoers with an evil punishment for that which they used to do of evil
7166 and when they had scornfully persisted in what they had been forbidden we said to them be apes despised
7167 then your lord declared he would send against them he who would oppress them cruelly till the day of resurrection swift is the retribution of your lord yet surely he is forgiving the most merciful
7168 we dispersed them through the earth in nations some were righteous others were not and tested them with good and evil in order that they return
7169 then others succeeded them who inherited the book and availed themselves of the vanities of this lower world saying it will be forgiven us but if similar vanities came their way they would again take them have they not taken the covenant of the book which they have studied to tell nothing of allah except what is true surely the everlasting life is better for the cautious do you not understand
7170 as for those who hold fast to the book and are steadfast in prayer we do not waste the wage of the righteous
7171 when we suspended the mountain over them as though it were a shadow and they feared that it was falling down on them we said take forcefully that which we have given you and remember what it contains in order that you keep from evil
7172 when your lord brought forth descendants from the loins of adams children and made them testify concerning themselves he said am i not your lord they replied we bear witness that you are lest you should say on the day of resurrection we had no knowledge of this
7173 or you say our forefathers were idolaters before and we were the descendants after them will you destroy us for the deeds of the vaindoers
7174 as such we make plain our verses in order that they return
7175 recite to them the news of he to whom we gave our verses and who turned away from them how satan overtook him so he was led astray
7176 had it been our will we would have raised with it but he clung to this earthly life and succumbed to his fancies his likeness was that of a dog whether you chase it away or let it alone it pants such is the example of a nation who belie our signs recount to them these narratives in order that they reflect
7177 evil is the example of those who belied our verses they wronged themselves
7178 he whom allah guides is one that is guided but he whom allah leaves in error shall surely be the lost
7179 for gehenna we have created many jinn and many humans they have hearts with which they cannot understand eyes with which they do not see and ears with which they do not hear they are like cattle rather they are the more misguided such are the heedless
7180 to allah belongs the finest names so call him by them and keep away from those who pervert them they shall be recompensed for the things they did
7181 among those whom we created there is a nation who guide with the truth and with it they are just
7182 as for those who belie our verses we will draw them on little by little from where they cannot tell
7183 and i respite them my stratagem is firm
7184 have they not reflected there is no madness in their companion he is but a plain warner
7185 will they not ponder upon the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that allah created and that it may be that their term is drawing near so in which speech will they believe thereafter
7186 none can guide those whom allah leaves in error he leaves them in their insolence wandering blindly
7187 they ask you about the hour and when it is to come say none knows except my lord he alone will reveal it at the appointed time it is heavy in the heavens and earth it will not come to you but suddenly they will question you as though you had full knowledge of it say its knowledge is with allah though most people are unaware
7188 say i do not have the power to acquire benefits or to avert harm from myself except by the will of allah had i possessed knowledge of the unseen i would have availed myself of much that is good and no harm would have touched me but i am only a warner and a bearer of glad tidings for a nation who believe
7189 it is he who created you from a soul from it he created its mate so that he might reside with her and when he had covered her she conceived and for a time her burden was light she carried it with ease but when it grew heavy they both supplicated to allah their lord grant us a goodly child and we will be among the thankful
7190 yet when he gave both of them the parents a goodly child they set up associates with him in return for what he had given them exalted be allah above that they associate with him
7191 will they associate that which cannot create a thing while they are created
7192 they cannot help them nor can they help themselves
7193 if you call them to guidance they will not follow you it is the same whether you call them or you are silent
7194 those whom you invoke other than allah are worshipers like yourselves call them and let them answer you if what you say is true
7195 have they feet to walk with have they hands to punish with have they eyes to see with have they ears to hear with say call on your partners and then try to scheme against me give me no respite
7196 my guardian is allah who has sent down the book he guards the righteous
7197 those whom you invoke other than him cannot help you nor can they help themselves
7198 if you call them to guidance they will not hear you you see them looking towards you but they cannot see
7199 accept the easing order with fine jurisprudence and avoid the ignorant
7200 when satan provokes you seek refuge in allah he is the hearing the knowing
7201 indeed when a visitation of satan touches the cautious worshipers they remember and then see clearly
7202 and their brothers they prolong them in error and they will never stop
7203 when you do not bring them a verse they say why have you not chosen one say i follow only what is revealed to me from my lord this koran is a veritable proof from your lord guidance and mercy for people who believe
7204 when the koran is recited listen to it in silence in order that allah has mercy upon you
7205 remember your lord in your soul with humility and fear and not with a loud voice morning and evening and do not be among the inattentive
7206 those who are with your lord are not too proud to worship him they exalt him and to him they prostrate
81 they ask you about the spoils of war say the spoils belong to allah and the messenger therefore have fear of allah and set things right between you obey allah and his messenger if you are believers
82 indeed the believers are those whose hearts quake at the mention of allah and when his verses are recited to them it increased them in faith they are those who put their trust in their lord
83 those who pray steadfastly and spend of that which we have provided them
84 those are in truth the believers they shall have degrees with their lord and forgiveness and a generous provision
85 it is like when your lord caused you to leave your home with the truth though some of the believers disliked it
86 they argued with you about the truth after it had been made clear as though they were being led to certain death while looking
87 remember when allah promised to grant you one of the two parties at badr and you wished for the one that was not strong allah wanted to establish the truth by his words and to sever the unbelievers to the last
88 in order that he might verify the truth and annul the falsehood even though the wrongdoers hated it
89 and when you prophet muhammad prayed to your lord for help he answered i am sending to your aid a thousand angels in succession
810 allah only made it to be glad tidings and so that your hearts may be satisfied victory comes only from allah he is almighty wise
811 when you were overcome by sleep as security from him he sent down water from the sky to cleanse you and to purify you of satans filth to strengthen your hearts and to steady your footsteps
812 and when allah revealed to the angels saying i shall be with you give courage to the believers i shall cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers strike them above the necks smite their finger tips
813 this is because they had made a breach with allah and his messenger he who makes a breach with allah and his messenger indeed allah is stern in retribution
814 that for you so taste it the punishment of the fire is for the unbelievers
815 believers when you encounter unbelievers on the march do not turn your backs to them in flight
816 if anyone on that day turns his back to them in flight except when maneuvering to fight or to join another party he shall be laden with the anger of allah and gehenna shall be his refuge an evil arrival
817 it was not you who killed them but allah slew them neither was it you who threw at them allah threw at them in order that he confers on the believers a fair benefit indeed allah is hearing knowing
818 allah will surely weaken the guile of the unbelievers
819 if you were seeking a victory victory has now come to you if you desist it will be better for you if you resume we will return and even if your forces are numerous they shall not help you at all and allah is with the believers
820 believers obey allah and his messenger and do not turn away from him when you are hearing
821 do not be like those who say we hear but they do not listen
822 the worst beasts before allah are those who are deaf dumb and do not understand
823 indeed had allah known any good in them he would have let them hear but even if he had made them hear they would have turned away swerving aside
824 believers respond to allah and the messenger when he calls you to that which revives you know that allah is between the person and his heart and that tohim you shall all be gathered
825 and be cautious against a sedition that will not smite the harmdoers alone know that the punishment of allah is stern
826 and remember how he gave you shelter when you were few in number and considered weak in the land ever fearing that the people would snatch you away but he gave you refuge and supported you with his victory and provided you with goodness so that you might give thanks
827 believers do not betray allah and the messenger nor knowingly betray your trust
828 know that your children and your wealth are but a temptation and that the reward with allah is great
829 believers if you fear allah he will give you a criteria and cleanse you of your sins and forgive you allah is the owner of great bounty
830 and when the unbelievers plotted against you prophet muhammad they sought to either take you captive or have you killed or expelled they plotted but allah in reply also plotted allah is the best in plotting
831 whenever our verses are recited to them they say we have heard them if we wished we could speak its like they are but tales of the ancients
832 when they say o allah if this is indeed the truth from you rain down upon us stones from heaven or bring us a painful punishment
833 but allah was not to punish them whilst you were living in their midst nor would allah punish them if they repeatedly ask forgiveness of him
834 and why should allah not punish them when they have barred others from the sacred mosque although they were not its guardians its only guardians are the cautious though most of them do not know
835 their prayers at the sacred house are nothing but whistling and clapping therefore taste the punishment for your disbelief
836 those who disbelieve spend their wealth to bar others from the path of allah they will spend it but it will become a regret for them then they will be overcome the unbelievers shall be gathered in gehenna
837 in order that allah will separate the wicked from the good he will heap the wicked one upon another and then heap them together and cast them in gehenna those shall be the losers
838 tell the unbelievers that if they abandon their ways he will forgive them what is past but if they return that was indeed the way of their forefathers who have passed away
839 fight them until persecution is no more and the religion of allah reigns supreme if they desist allah sees the things they do
840 but if they turn away know that allah is your guardian he is the best guardian and the best giver of victory
841 and know that one fifth of whatever you take as spoils belong to allah the messenger kinsmen of the messenger the orphans the needy and the destitute traveler if you believe in allah and what we sent down to our worshiper on the day of victory the day when the two armies met allah has power over all things
842 and when you were encamped on the nearside and they the unbelievers on the farther side with the caravan below had you made an appointment with them you would have surely failed to keep it but allah sought to accomplish what he had ordained so that by clear evidence he who was destined to perish might perish and he who was destined to live might live surely allah is hearing knowing
843 and when allah made them appear to you in a vision as a small band had he showed them to you as many your courage would have failed you and you would have quarreled over the affair but allah saved he knows the inner most thoughts in the chests
844 and when you met them he showed them in your eyes as being few and decreased your number in their eyes so that allah might determine what was ordained to allah all matters return
845 believers when you meet an army stand firm and remember allah abundantly in order that you are prosperous
846 obey allah and his messenger and do not dispute with one another lest you should lose courage and your resolve weaken have patience allah is with those who are patient
847 do not be like those who left their homes elated with insolence and showing off to people barring others from the path of allah but allah encompasses what they do
848 and when satan made their foul deeds seem fair to them he said no one shall conquer you this day i shall be your savior but when the two armies came within sight of each other he took to his heels saying i reject you for i can see what you cannot i fear allah allah is stern in retribution
849 and when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was sickness said those their religion has deceived them but whosoever puts his trust in allah indeed allah is mighty wise
850 if you could see the angels when they carry off the souls of the unbelievers beating their faces and their backs saying taste the punishment of burning
851 that is for what your hands have forwarded allah is not unjust to his worshipers
852 like pharaohs family and those who have gone before them they disbelieved the signs of allah therefore allah seized them in their sinfulness mighty is allah and stern in retribution
853 this is because allah would never change his favor that he bestowed upon a nation until they change what is in their hearts allah is hearing knowing
854 like pharaohs family and those who have gone before them they belied the signs of their lord and so we destroyed them for their sins and drowned pharaohs family they were all harmdoers
855 indeed the basest creatures before allah are the unbelievers for they will not believe
856 those with whom you have made a treaty then break their treaty with you every time having no fear of allah
857 if you meet them in battle cause their example to scatter those behind them so that they remember
858 if you fear treachery from any of your allies you can dissolve with them equally allah does not love the treacherous
859 do not suppose that the unbelievers have outstripped allah they cannot frustrate me
860 muster against them whatever you are able of force and tethers ropes of horses so that you strike terror into the enemies of allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know but allah does all that you spend in the way of allah shall be repaid to you you shall not be wronged
861 if they incline to peace incline to it also and put your trust in allah surely he is the hearing the knowing
862 should they seek to deceive you allah is sufficient for you it is he who supported you with his victory and with believers
863 and brought their hearts together if you had given away all the riches of the earth you could not have so united them but allah has united them he isalmighty wise
864 o prophet allah suffices you and whosoever follows you of the believers
865 o prophet urge the believers to fight if there are twenty patient men among you you shall overcome two hundred and if there are a hundred they shall overcome a thousand unbelievers for they are a nation who do not understand
866 allah has now lightened it for you for he knows that there is weakness amongst you if there are a hundred patient men among you they shall overcome two hundred and if there are a thousand they shall by the permission of allah defeat two thousand allah is with the patient
867 it is not for any prophet to have prisoners in order to slaughter many in the land you want the gains of this life and allah wants the everlasting life and allah is mighty wise
868 had there not been a previous writing from allah you would have been afflicted by a mighty punishment
869 eat of what you have taken from the spoils such is lawful and good and fear allah allah is forgiving and most merciful
870 o prophet say to those you have taken captive in your hand if allah finds goodness in your hearts he will give you that which is better than what has been taken from you and he will forgive you allah is forgiving the most merciful
871 but if they seek to betray you they had betrayed allah before but he has let you overcome them allah is the knower the wise
872 those who believe and migrated and fought for the cause of allah with their wealth and their persons and those who sheltered them and helped them shall be guides to each other and those who believe but have not emigrated you have no guidance towards them till they emigrate but if they seek your help in the cause of your religion it is your duty to help them except against a nation with whom you have a treaty allah sees the things you do
873 the unbelievers they are guides of one another unless you do this there will be persecution in the land and great corruption
874 those who believe and migrated from their homes and fought for the way of allah and those who have sheltered them and helped them they are truly the believers theirs shall be forgiveness and a generous provision
875 and those who believed afterwards and emigrated and struggled with you they are of you and in the book of allah the near kinsmen deserve one another in inheritance allah has knowledge of all things
91 an acquittal from allah and his messenger to the idolaters with whom you have made agreements
92 for four months you shall journey freely in the land but know that you shall not render allah incapable and that allah will humiliate the unbelievers
93 a proclamation from allah and his messenger to the people on the day of the grand pilgrimage allah rejects and his messenger rejects the idolaters so if you repent that will be better for you but if you turn your backs know that you cannot frustrate allah and give glad tidings to the unbelievers of a painful punishment
94 except those idolaters who have fully honored their treaties with you and aided none against you with these fulfill your covenant till their term surely allah loves the righteous
95 when the sacred months are over slay the idolaters wherever you find them take them and confine them then lie in ambush everywhere for them if they repent and establish the prayer and pay the obligatory charity let them go their way allah is forgiving and the most merciful
96 if an idolater seeks asylum with you give him protection in order that he hears the word of allah and then convey him to his place of safety because they are a nation who do not know
97 how can the idolaters have any treaty with allah and his messenger except those with whom you have made treaties by the sacred mosque so long as they are straight with you so be straight with them allah loves the righteous
98 how if they prevail against you they will respect neither agreements nor ties of kindred they satisfy you with their tongues but their hearts are averse and most of them are wicked
99 they sell the verses of allah for a small price and bar others from his path evil is what they have been doing
910 they honor with the believers neither bonds nor treaties such are the transgressors
911 if they repent and establish the prayer and pay the obligatory charity they shall become your brothers in the religion so we make plain our verses for a nation that knows
912 but if after coming to terms with you they break their oaths and revile your belief fight the leaders of the disbelief for they have no oaths in order that they will desist
913 will you not fight against those who have broken their oaths and conspired to expel the messenger they were the first to attack you do you fear them surely allah has better rights that you fear him if you are believers
914 fight them allah will punish them with your hands and degrade them he will grant you victory over them and heal the chests of a believing nation
915 he will take away all anger from their hearts allah turns to whomsoever he will allah is knowing wise
916 did you suppose that you would be left before allah has known those of you who fought and did not take a confidant other than allah his messenger and the believers allah is aware of what you do
917 idolaters should not inhabit the mosques of allah bearing witness against themselves with disbelief those their deeds have been annulled and in the fire they shall live for ever
918 none should inhabit the mosques of allah except those who believe in allah and the last day establish their prayers and pay the obligatory charity and fear none except allah may these be among the guided
919 do you consider giving drink to the pilgrims and inhabiting the sacred mosque is the same as one who believes in allah and the last day and struggles in the way of allah these are not held equal by allah allah does not guide the harmdoers
920 those who believe and migrated and struggle in the way of allah with their wealth and their persons are greater in rank with allah it is they who are the winners
921 their lord gives them glad tidings of mercy from him and pleasure for them await gardens in which there is eternal bliss
922 where they shall live for ever the wage with allah is great indeed
923 believers do not take your fathers or your brothers for a guide if they love disbelief rather than belief whosoever of you takes them for guides are the harmdoers
924 say if your fathers your sons your brothers your wives your tribes the property you have acquired the merchandise you fear will not be sold and the homes you love are dearer to you than allah his messenger and the struggling for his way then wait until allah shall bring his command allah does not guide the evildoers
925 allah has helped you on many a battlefield in the battle of hunain when your numbers were pleasing you they availed you nothing the earth for all its vastness seemed to close in upon you and you turned your backs and fled
926 then allah caused his tranquility sechina to descend upon his messenger and the believers he sent legions you did not see and sternly punished the unbelievers such is the recompense of the unbelievers
927 yet thereafter allah turns to whom he will he is the forgiving the most merciful
928 believers the idolaters are unclean do not let them approach the sacred mosque after this year if you fear poverty allah if he wills will enrich you through his bounty he is knowing wise
929 fight those who neither believe in allah nor the last day who do not forbid what allah and his messenger have forbidden and do not embrace the religion of the truth being among those who have been given the book bible and the torah until they pay tribute out of hand and have been humiliated
930 the jews say ezra is the son of allah while the christians who follow paul say the messiah is the son of allah such are their assertions by which they imitate those who disbelieved before allah fights them how perverted are they
931 they take their rabbis and monks as lords besides allah and the messiah son of mary though they were ordered to worship but one god there is no god except he exalted is he above that they associate with him
932 they desire to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths but allah seeks only to perfect his light though the unbelievers hate it
933 it is he who has sent forth his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to uplift it above every religion no matter how much the idolaters hate it
934 believers many are the rabbis and monks who in falsehood defraud people of their possessions and bar people from the path of allah give glad tidings of a painful punishment to those who treasure gold and silver and do not spend it in the way of allah
935 on that day they the treasures will be heated in the fire of gehenna hell and their foreheads sides and backs will be branded with them and told these are the things which you have treasured taste then that which you were treasuring
936 the number of the months with allah is twelve in the book of allah the day when he created the heavens and the earth of these four are sacred that is the right religion therefore do not wrong yourselves in them and fight against the unbelievers all together as they themselves fight against you all together know that allah is with the cautious
937 the postponement of sacred months is an increase in disbelief in which the unbelievers are misguided they allow it one year and forbid it another year so that they can make up for the months that allah has sanctified so making lawful what allah has forbidden their foul acts seem fair to them allah does not guide the unbelievers
938 believers why is it that when it is said to you march in the way of allah you linger with heaviness in the land are you content with this life rather than theeverlasting life yet the enjoyment of this life in comparison to the everlasting life is little
939 if you do not go forth he will punish you with a painful punishment and replace you by another nation you will in no way harm him for allah has power over all things
940 if you do not help him allah will help him as he helped him when he was driven out with one other abu bakr by the unbelievers when the two were in the cave he said to his companion do not sorrow allah is with us then allah caused his tranquility shechina to descend upon him and supported him with legions of angels you did not see and he made the word of the unbelievers the lowest and the word of allah is the highest allah is mighty wise
941 whether lightly or heavily march on and fight for the way of allah with your wealth and your persons this will be best for you if you but knew
942 had the gain been immediate or the journey easy they would have followed you but the distance seemed far to them yet they will swear by allah had we been able we would have gone out with you they bring destruction upon their souls allah knows that they are lying
943 allah has forgiven you why did you give them leave to stay behind until it was clear to you which of them was truthful and knew those who lied
944 those who believe in allah and the last day will not ask your permission so that they may struggle with their wealth and their selves allah knows best the righteous
945 only those who ask your permission do not believe in allah and the last day and whose hearts are filled with doubt and in their doubt they waiver
946 had they intended to set forth with you they would have prepared themselves for it but allah did not like their going forth and held them back and it was said stay back with those who stay back
947 had they gone forth among you they would only have increased your burden and run to and fro in your midst seeking to stir up sedition between you and some of you would listen to them and allah knows the harmdoers
948 beforehand they had already sought to stir up sedition and turned things upside down for you until the truth came and the command of allah appeared although they were averse
949 among them are some that say give us leave and do not expose us to temptation surely they have already succumbed to temptation gehenna shall encompass the unbelievers
950 if good comes to you it grieves them but if hardship befalls you they say we have taken our precautions and they turn away rejoicing
951 say nothing will befall us except what allah has ordained he is our guardian in allah let the believers put their trust
952 say are you waiting for anything to befall us except one of the two excellent things victory or martyrdom we are waiting for the punishment of allah to smite you either from him or at our hands wait if you will we are waiting
953 say whether you spend voluntarily or reluctantly it shall not be accepted from you for you are a wicked nation
954 nothing prevents their offerings from being accepted except that they do not believe in allah and his messenger they do not come to the prayer except lazily and spend grudgingly
955 let neither their wealth nor their children please you through these allah seeks to punish them in this life and that their souls depart while they are unbelievers
956 they swear by allah that they belong with you yet they are not of you they are a nation that are afraid
957 if they could find a shelter or caverns or any place to creep into they will turn stampeding to it
958 there are some among them who find fault with you concerning the distribution of alms if a share is given to them they are contented but if they receive nothing then they are angry
959 would that they were wellpleased with what allah and his messenger have given them and would say allah is sufficient for us allah will provide for us from his abundance and so will his messenger to allah we hope
960 the obligatory charity shall be only for the poor and the needy and for those who work to collect it and to influence hearts to belief for ransoming captives and debtors in the way of allah and the destitute traveler it is an obligation from allah allah is knowing wise
961 and there are others among them who hurt the prophet saying he lends an ear to everything say he lends an ear of good for you he believes in allah and trusts the believers and he is a mercy to the believers among you those who hurt the messenger of allah for them there is a painful punishment
962 they swear in the name of allah in order to please you but it is more just that they should please allah and his messenger if they are believers
963 are they not aware that whosoever opposes allah and his messenger shall live for ever in the fire of gehenna that surely is the greatest degradation
964 the hypocrites are afraid lest a chapter be sent down against them telling them what is in their hearts say mock if you will allah will surely bring forth what you are fearing
965 if you question them they will say we were only plunging and playing say were you mocking allah his verses and his messenger
966 do not make excuses you have disbelieved after you believed if we forgive some of you we will punish others for they were sinners
967 be they men or women the hypocrites are all alike they order what is evil forbid what is just and tighten their purse strings they forsook allah so allah forsook them surely the hypocrites are evildoers
968 allah has promised the hypocrites both men and women and the unbelievers the fire of gehenna they shall live in it for ever it is sufficient for them allah has cursed them and for them is a lasting punishment
969 you are like those before you they were stronger than you in might and had greater riches and more children they took enjoyment in their share so do you take enjoyment in your share as those before you took enjoyment in their share you have plunged as they plunged those their works are annulled failed in this world and in the everlasting life those they are the losers
970 have they not heard the news of those who have gone before them the news of the nations of noah aad and thamood of abrahams nation and the people of midian and the ruined cities their messengers showed them clear signs allah did not harm them but they harmed themselves
971 the believers both men and women are guides to each other they order what is just and forbid what is evil they establish their prayers and pay the obligatory charity and obey allah and his messenger on these allah will have mercy he is mighty wise
972 allah has promised the believing men and women gardens underneath which rivers flow in which they shall live for ever goodly mansions in the gardens of eden and the pleasure from allah which is greater that is the greatest winning
973 o prophet struggle with the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh with them gehenna shall be their refuge an evil arrival
974 they swear by allah that they said nothing yet they did utter the word of disbelief and disbelieved after they had submitted they intended what they never attained to and took revenge only that allah enriched them and his messenger of his bounty if they repent it will indeed be better for them but if they turn away allah will sternly punish them both in this world and in the everlasting life they have none on earth to protect or help them
975 some of them have made a covenant with allah if allah gives to us of his bounty we will give charity and be of the righteous
976 but when allah had bestowed his bounty on them they became greedy and turned away swerving aside
977 he has caused hypocrisy to be in their hearts till the day they meet him because they have changed what they promised allah and because they were liars
978 did they not know that allah knows their secret and what they conspire together and that allah knows all the unseen
979 as for those who taunt the believers who give charity voluntarily and scoff at those who give according to their means allah will scoff at them theirs shall be a painful punishment
980 it is the same whether or not you beg forgiveness for them if you beg forgiveness for them seventy times allah will not forgive them for they have disbelieved in allah and his messenger allah does not guide the evildoers
981 those who were left behind were glad that they were left behind by the messenger of allah for they disliked to struggle in the way of allah with their wealth and their persons they said do not go forth in the heat say the fire of gehenna is more hot would that they understood
982 they shall laugh but little and shed many tears so shall they be recompensed for their earnings
983 if allah brings you back to a party of them and they ask permission to march with you say you shall never march with me nor shall you fight with me against any enemy you were pleased to remain on the first occasion therefore you shall now stay with those who remain behind
984 you shall never pray over any one of them when he is dead nor stand over his tomb for they disbelieved in allah and his messenger and died whilst they were sinners
985 let neither their riches nor their children please you with it allah wants to punish them in this life so that their souls depart while they disbelieve
986 whenever a chapter is sent down saying believe in allah and struggle with his messenger the rich among them asked you to excuse them saying leave us with those who are to stay behind
987 they were content to be with those who stayed behind a seal was set upon their hearts so they do not understand
988 but the messenger and those who believed with him struggled with their wealth and their selves for them awaits goodness and those are the winners
989 allah has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow in which they shall live for ever that is the greatest winning
990 some arabs of the desert who had an excuse came asking permission to stay behind whilst those who belied allah and his messenger remained behind a painful punishment shall fall on those of them that disbelieved
991 there is no fault for the weak the sick and those lacking the means to spend to stay behind if they are true to allah and his messenger there is no way against the righteous allah is forgiving the most merciful
992 nor shall those who came to you to be provided with mounts and when you said i can find no mounts for you they turned back their eyes streaming with tears grieving that they could not find the means to spend
993 but the blame is to be laid on those who asked permission of you whilst they are rich they are content to remain with those who stay behind allah has set a seal upon their hearts so they do not know
994 when you return they will apologize to you say make no excuses we will not believe you allah has already told us of your news surely allah and his messenger will see your work then you will be returned to the knower of the unseen and the visible and he will inform you of what you were doing
995 when you return to them they will swear to you by allah that you might turn aside from them let them alone they are unclean gehenna shall be their refuge a recompense for their earnings
996 they will swear to you in order to please you but if you will be pleased with them allah will not be pleased with the evildoing nation
997 the bedouin arabs surpass the city dwellers in disbelief and hypocrisy and are more likely not to know the bounds that allah has sent down to his messenger but allah is knowing wise
998 some arabs banu asad and ghatfan tribes regard what they spend as a compulsory fine and wait for some misfortune to befall you theirs shall be the evil turn allah is hearing knowing
999 yet there are some arabs juhaina and muszaina tribes who believe in allah and the last day and regard what they spend as a means of bringing them close to allah and to the prayers of the messenger indeed they are an offering for them allah will admit them to his mercy he is forgiving merciful
9100 as for the first outstrippers among the migrants and supporters and those who followed them in doing good allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with him he has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow where they shall live for ever that is the greatest winning
9101 some of the bedouin arabs around you are hypocrites and so are some of the people of madinah who are well versed in hypocrisy you do not know them but we do twice we will punish them then they shall return to a mighty punishment
9102 there are others who have confessed their sins they intermixed good deeds with another evil it may be that allah will turn towards them in mercy allah is forgiving merciful
9103 take charity from their wealth in order that they are thereby cleansed and purified and pray for them for your prayer is a comforting mercy for them allah is hearing knowing
9104 do they not know that allah accepts the repentance of his worshipers and takes their charity and that allah is the forgiving the merciful
9105 say allah will see your works and so will his messenger and the believers then you shall be returned to the knower of the unseen and the visible and he will inform you of what you were doing
9106 there are others who must wait for the commandment of allah he will either punish or turn towards them and allah is knowing wise
9107 and there are those who have taken a mosque to cause harm disbelief and to divide the believers and as a place of ambush for those who fought allah and his messenger before they swear we desired nothing but good but allah bears witness that they are liars
9108 you shall never stand there a mosque founded upon piety from the first day is worthier for you to stand in in it are men who love to purify themselves allah loves those who purify themselves
9109 is he who founds his building on the fear of allah and his pleasure better or he who founds his building on the brink of a crumbling edge so that it will tumble with him into the fire of gehenna allah does not guide the harmdoers
9110 the buildings they have built will always cause doubt in their hearts unless their hearts are torn into pieces allah is knowing wise
9111 allah has purchased from the believers their selves and possessions and for them is paradise they fight in the way of allah slay and are slain that is a binding promise upon him in the torah the gospel and the koran and who is there that more truthfully fulfills his covenant than allah therefore rejoice in the bargain you have bargained with him that is the mighty winning
9112 those who repent those who worship allah and praise him those who journey those who bow those who prostrate themselves those who order righteousness and forbid evil and those who observe the limits of allah give glad tidings to the believers
9113 it is not for the prophet or the believers to ask forgiveness for idolaters even though they are near kindred after it has become clear that they are the inhabitants of hell
9114 abraham only asked for forgiveness for his father because of a promise he had made to him but when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of allah he declared himself quit of him surely abraham was earnest in his supplication and tenderhearted
9115 nor will allah lead a nation astray after he has given them guidance until he has made clear to them all that they should guard against allah has knowledge of all things
9116 indeed to allah belong the kingdom of the heavens and the earth he gives life and causes death other than allah you have neither a guardian nor a helper
9117 in the hour of adversity allah turned in mercy to the prophet the emigrants of mecca and the supporters of madinah who followed him when some of their hearts were about to swerve away he turned to them indeed he is gentle the most merciful
9118 and to the three who were left behind at the battle of tabuk until the earth became narrow with all its vastness and their souls became narrow for them they knew there was no shelter from allah except in him then he turned to them in mercy so that they might also turn in repentance allah is the turner the most merciful
9119 believers fear allah and stand with the truthful
9120 the people of madinah and the arabs who dwell around them have no cause to stay behind the messenger of allah or to prefer their lives to his they are neither stricken by thirst nor by tiredness nor yet by hunger in the way of allah nor do they take steps that anger the unbelievers nor gain any gain from an enemy but that it is counted as a righteous deed allah does not waste the wage of the gooddoers
9121 each sum they spend be it small or large and each valley they cross is written to their account so that allah may recompense them for their best deeds
9122 the believers should not go forth altogether rather a party from each section should go forth to become well versed in the religion and when they return to their people warn them in order that they may beware
9123 believers fight the unbelievers who are near you let them find firmness in you know that allah is with those who are cautious
9124 whenever a chapter is sent down to you some ask which of you has it increased in belief it will surely increase the belief of the believers and they are joyful
9125 as for those whose hearts are diseased they will be increased in filth added to their filth so that they die as unbelievers
9126 do they not see how once or twice every year they are tried yet still they neither repent nor remember
9127 whenever a chapter is sent down they glance at each other asking does anyone see you then they turn away allah has turned away their hearts for they are a nation who do not understand
9128 indeed there has come to you a messenger from your own he grieves for your suffering and is anxious about you and is gentle merciful to the believers
9129 therefore if they turn away say allah is sufficient for me there is no god except he in him i have put my trust he is the lord of the mighty throne
101 aliflaamra those are the verses of the wise book
102 is it a wonder to the people that we revealed to a man from among themselves warn mankind and bear the glad tidings to those who believe that they stand firm with their lord yet the unbelievers say this is a clear sorcerer
103 indeed your lord is allah who in six days created the heavens and the earth and then willed to the throne directing affairs there is no intercessor except by his permission such is allah your lord therefore worship him will you not remember
104 to him all of you will return together this is in truth the promise of allah he originates creation then he revives it so that he may recompense those who believe and do righteous deeds as for the unbelievers theirs is a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment for their disbelief
105 it was he that made the sun a brightness and the moon a light and determined it in phases so that you might know the number of years and the reckoning allah did not create them except in truth and distinguishes the verses to a nation who know
106 in the alternation of the night and day and in all that allah has created in the heavens and the earth surely there are signs for people who are cautious
107 those who do not expect to meet us and are wellpleased with this life and are satisfied with it and those who are inattentive to our signs
108 for them their refuge is the fire for what they have been earning
109 indeed those who believe and do righteous works their lord will guide them for their belief beneath them rivers will flow in gardens of bliss
1010 in it their supplication will be exaltations to you allah and their greeting will be peace they will end their supplication with praise be to allah lord of the all the worlds
1011 if allah should hasten evil to people as they would hasten good their term would already have been decided but we leave those who do not expect to meet us to wander blindly in their insolence
1012 when affliction befalls a man he supplicates to us lying on his side sitting or standing but as soon as we relieve him from his affliction he continues in the same way as though he never supplicated to us when harm touched him so it is that which the sinners were doing seem fairly decorated to them
1013 we destroyed generations before you when they did evil when their messengers came to them with clear verses they would not believe so we recompense the sinning nation
1014 after them we made you their successors in the earth so that we might see how you would do
1015 when our verses clear verses are recited to them those who do not reckon to meet us say bring a koran other than this or make changes in it say it is not for me to change it by myself i follow nothing except what is sent down to me indeed if i should rebel against my lord i fear the punishment of a great day
1016 say prophet muhammad had allah willed i would not have recited it to you nor would he have made it known to you i lived among you all my life before it was sent down will you not understand
1017 who does greater evil than he who forges a lie about allah or belies his verses indeed the evildoers do not prosper
1018 they worship other than allah that which can neither harm nor benefit them and say these are our intercessors with allah say will you tell allah of something he does not know about either in the heavens or earth exaltations to him exalted be he above what they associate
1019 before mankind were but one nation then they differed with one another but for a word that preceded from your lord it the matters over which they differed had already been decided
1020 they say why has no sign been sent down to him from his lord say the unseen belongs to allah alone wait if you will i am one of those who wait
1021 when we let people taste our mercy after they had been afflicted by hardship they devise against our verses say allah is more swift in devising indeed our messengers the angels are writing down whatever you devise
1022 it is he who conveys you by land and sea when you are on board the ship and the ships run with them upon a fair breeze they are joyful but when a strong wind and waves come upon them from every side and they think they are encompassed they supplicate to allah making their religion his sincerely saying if you save us from this we will indeed be among the thankful
1023 but when he has saved them see how they become wrongfully insolent in the land people your insolence is only against yourselves the enjoyment of this present life then to us you shall return and we shall tell you what you did
1024 this present life is like the water we send down from the sky the plants of the earth mix with it and from it mankind and cattle eat then when the earth has become lush and adorned its inhabitants think they have power over it our command comes upon it by night or day and we cause it to be stubble just as though it had not flourished the day before in this way we distinguish our verses for those who reflect
1025 allah invites you to the house of peace he guides whom he will to a straight path
1026 for those who do good is a fine reward and a surplus neither dust nor shame shall cover their faces those are the companions of paradise in it they shall live for ever
1027 as for those who have earned evil deeds evil shall be recompensed with its like abasement will cover them they shall have none to defend them from allah as though their faces were covered with parts of the blackness of night those they are the companions of the fire in it they shall live for ever
1028 and on the day when we assemble them all together we shall say to those who associated other gods with allah go to your place you and your associates then we will separate them and their associates will say to them it was not us that you worshipped
1029 allah is a sufficient witness between us and you surely we were heedless of your worship
1030 there each soul shall prove its past deeds they shall be restored to allah their guardian the true and that which they forged will escape from them
1031 say who provides for you from heaven and earth or who owns the hearing and the sight who brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living who directs the affair surely they will say allah then say then will you not be fearful
1032 such is allah your lord the true what is there after truth anything except error then how are you turned around from faith
1033 so the word of your lord is realized against the evildoers that they do not believe
1034 say is there any among your associates who originates creation then cause it to be revived yet again say allah he originates creation then revives it yet again how is it that you are so perverted
1035 say do any of your partners guide you to the truth say allah he guides to the truth who then is worthier to be followed he who guides to the truth or he who cannot guide unless he himself is guided what is the matter with you how then can you judge
1036 most of them follow nothing except conjecture but conjecture does not help against the truth allah knows the things they do
1037 this koran could not have been forged by other than allah it confirms what was before it a distinguishing book in which there is no doubt from the lord of all the worlds
1038 do they say he has forged it say compose one chapter like it and call upon whom you will other than allah to help you if what you say is true
1039 they have belied that which they did not understand of its knowledge nor has its interpretation reached them those who were before also belied but see how was the end of the harmdoers
1040 some believe in it while others do not believe it your lord knows well the corrupters
1041 if they belie you say i have my work you have your work you are quit of what i do and i am quit of what you do
1042 some of them listen to you but can you make the deaf hear you even though they cannot understand
1043 some of them look to you but can you guide the blind even though they do not see
1044 indeed allah does not wrong mankind a thing but they wrong themselves
1045 the day when he will gather them it will be as though they had lingered but an hour of the day and they will recognize one another lost are those who belied the meeting with their lord and were not guided
1046 whether we let you see some of that with which we promised them or we call you to us to us they shall return allah is witness of the things they do
1047 every nation has its messenger then when their messenger comes the matter is justly decided between them they are not wronged
1048 they ask if what you say is true when will this promise come
1049 say i have no power to benefit or harm myself except as allah wills to every nation is a fixed term and when their term comes they cannot delay it for an hour nor can they bring it forward
1050 say have you considered should his punishment come upon you by night or by day what part of it would the sinners try to hasten
1051 and when it overtakes you is it then that you will believe in it now when you already try to hasten it
1052 then it shall be said to the evildoers taste the punishment of eternity shall you be recompensed except according to what you earned
1053 they ask you to tell them if it is true say yes by my lord it is true and you cannot frustrate it
1054 if each soul that has done evil had all that is in the earth it would offer it for its ransom and secretly they will feel regret when they see the punishment and the matter is justly decided between them and they are not wronged
1055 indeed to allah belongs everything in the heavens and the earth indeed the promise of allah is true though most of them do not have knowledge
1056 it is he who gives life and causes death and to him you shall be returned
1057 people an admonition has now come to you from your lord and a healing for what is in the chests a guide and a mercy to believers
1058 say in the bounty of allah and his mercy let them rejoice it the koran is better than that which they hoard
1059 say have you considered the provision that allah has sent down for you and some you have made unlawful and some lawful say has allah given you his permission or do you forge falsehood against allah
1060 what will those who forged falsehood about allah think on the day of resurrection allah is bountiful to mankind yet most of them do not give thanks
1061 you are not engaged in any matter neither do you recite any portion of the koran nor do you do any work except that we are witnesses over you when you press upon it not even as much as the weight of an ant in earth or heaven escapes your lord nor is there anything smaller or greater but it is recorded in a clear book
1062 indeed there shall be neither fear nor sorrow upon the guided by allah
1063 those who believe and are cautious
1064 there is for them glad tidings in this present life and in the everlasting life the word of allah is unchanging that is the mighty triumph
1065 do not let their speech grieve you all might belongs to allah he is the hearing the knowing
1066 attention indeed to allah belongs everyone that is in the heavens and in the earth those who call upon associates other than allah follow nothing but assumptions they are only lying
1067 he it is who has made the night for your rest and the day to see surely in this there are signs for people who listen
1068 they say allah has taken a son exaltations be to him allah rich is he to him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth you have no authority for this what do you say of allah what you do not know
1069 say those who forge falsehoods against allah shall not prosper
1070 they take their enjoyment in this world but to us they shall return then we shall let them taste the terrible punishment because they were unbelievers
1071 and recite to them the story of noah he said to his nation o my nation if my standing here reminding you of the verses of allah grieves you and in allah i have put my trust decide upon your affair with your associates then do not let your affair worry you come to a decision about me and give me no respite
1072 then if you turn your backs i have not asked of you a wage my wage falls only on allah i am commanded to be from those who surrender muslims
1073 but they belied him therefore we saved him and those who were with him in the ark and we made them caliphs and we drowned those who belied our verses see what was the end of those who were warned
1074 after him we sent messengers to their nation they brought them clear signs but they were not of those to believe because they had belied it previously sowe seal the hearts of the evildoers
1075 then after them we sent moses and aaron with our signs to pharaoh and his council but they were arrogant for they were a sinful nation
1076 when the truth came to them from us they said this is indeed clear magic
1077 moses said is this what you say of the truth when it has come to you is this sorcery sorcerers do not prosper
1078 they said have you come to turn us away from that which we found our fathers practicing in order that the domination of the land might belong to you two we do not believe you
1079 then pharaoh said bring every skilled sorcerer
1080 when the sorcerers came moses said to them cast down what you will cast
1081 and when they had cast moses said what you have brought is sorcery surely allah will render it as nothing allah does not put right the work of the corrupt
1082 allah verifies the truth by his words even though the sinners hate it
1083 so none believed moses except a few of his nation because they feared that pharaoh and their council would persecute them pharaoh was mighty in theland and one of the evildoers
1084 moses said o my nation if you believe in allah put your trust in him if you have surrendered muslims
1085 they said we have put our trust in allah our lord do not let us be a temptation to the harmdoing nation
1086 save us through your mercy from the unbelieving nation
1087 we revealed to moses and his brother take certain houses for your people in egypt make your houses a direction for pray establish the prayer and give glad tidings to the believers
1088 our lord supplicated moses you have given pharaoh and his council adornments and possessions in this life our lord let them go astray from yourpath our lord destroy their possessions and harden their hearts so that they shall not believe until they see the painful punishment
1089 he allah said your supplication is answered so go straight and do not follow the way of those who do not know
1090 we brought the children of israel through the sea and pharaoh and his legions pursued them arrogantly and frantically but as he was drowning he cried out now i believe that there is no god except he in whom the children of israel believe i am of those that surrender muslims
1091 allah said now you believe but before this you rebelled and were of the corrupt
1092 we shall deliver you ramsis ii with your body this day so that you may be a sign to those after you indeed many people pay no heed to our signs
1093 thereafter we settled the children of israel in a blessed land and provided them with good things they did not differ until knowledge was given them indeed your lord will decide between them on the day of resurrection
1094 if you are in doubt of what we have sent down to you ask those who recite the book before you the truth has come to you from your lord therefore do not be of the doubters
1095 do not be among those who belie the verses of allah for then you would be among the losers
1096 those against whom the word of your lord will be realized will not believe
1097 even though every sign comes to them until they see the painful punishment
1098 why was there never a village that believed and its belief benefited them except jonahs nation when they believed we spared them from a degrading punishment in this life and we gave them enjoyment for awhile
1099 had your lord willed whosoever is in the earth all would have believed would you then constrain people until they believe
10100 no soul can believe except by the permission of allah upon those who do not understand lays his punishment
10101 say see what is in the heavens and the earth but neither signs nor warnings help the unbelievers
10102 do they watch and wait for anything except for days similar to those who passed away before them say wait i shall be with you among those who arewaiting
10103 then we shall save our messengers and the believers it is our obligated duty we shall save those who believe
10104 say o people if you are in doubt concerning my religion i worship none of those you worship other than allah but i worship allah who will cause you to die for i am commanded to be among the believers
10105 and set your face towards the religion being of pure faith and do not be among the idolaters
10106 do not pray to other than allah to anything that can neither help nor harm you for if you do you will become a harmdoer
10107 if allah touches you an affliction none can remove it except he and if he wills any good for you none can repel his bounty he causes it to fall upon whosoever of his worshippers that he will he is the forgiving the most merciful
10108 say o people the truth has come to you from your lord whosoever is guided is guided only for himself and whosoever goes astray he is astray for himself i am not a guardian over you
10109 follow what is revealed to you and be patient till allah shall judge and he is the best of judges
111 aliflaamra this is a book whose verses are clear and then distinguished from him the wise the aware
112 worship none except allah i am for you a warner sent from him and a bearer of glad tidings
113 and ask forgiveness of your lord and then repent to him he will give you enjoyment till a stated term and will give of his bounty to those of grace but if you turn away i fear for you the punishment of a mighty day
114 to allah you shall all return he has power over all things
115 see they cover their chests to conceal from him but when they wrap themselves in their clothes he knows what they hide and what they reveal indeed he knows every thought within the chest
116 there is not a crawling creature on the earth whose provision is not by allah he knows its resting place and its repository all is in a clear book
117 it is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days and his throne was upon the waters that he might try you and see which of you excel in works if you say after death you shall be raised up the unbelievers will say this is nothing but clear sorcery
118 and if we delay the punishment till an appointed time they will ask what has detained it indeed the day will come to them it will not be turned awayfrom them and that they mocked at will encompass them
119 if we let a human taste our mercy and then withhold it from him he becomes desperate and ungrateful
1110 and if after adversity had come upon him we let him taste prosperity he says evil has left me see he is jubilant and boastful
1111 except those who are patient and do good deeds for them awaits forgiveness and a mighty wage
1112 perhaps you are leaving part of what has been sent down to you and your chest is straitened by it because they say why has no treasure been sent down to him or an angel come with him you are only a warner and allah is a guardian over everything
1113 or do they say he has forged it say to them then produce ten forged chapters like it call if you are able upon other than allah if what you say is true
1114 but if they do not answer you know that it has been sent down with the knowledge of allah and that there is no god except he so have you surrendered become muslims
1115 we shall pay those who desire the present life and its adornments in full for the work they have done therein they shall not be defrauded
1116 those are they who in the everlasting life will have only the fire there their deeds will have failed and their works will be void
1117 then what of he who stands upon a clear proof from his lord recited by a witness from him and before him is the book of moses for a guide and a mercy those believe in it but as for those partisans who disbelieve in it their promised land shall be the fire therefore do not doubt it it is the truth from your lord yet most people do not believe
1118 and who is greater in evil than he who forges a lie against allah those they shall be brought before their lord and witnesses will say those are they who lied against their lord indeed the curse of allah shall fall upon the evildoers
1119 who bar others from the path of allah and seek to make it crooked they disbelieve in the everlasting life
1120 they are unable to frustrate him on the earth there is none to protect them except allah those their punishment shall be doubled they could neither hear nor see
1121 those are they that have lost their souls and that which they forged has left them
1122 without doubt they will be the greatest losers in the everlasting life
1123 whereas those who believe and do good deeds and humble themselves before their lord they are the companions of paradise and there they shall live for ever
1124 the likeness of the two parties is as one who is blind and deaf and one that sees and hears are they equally alike will you not remember
1125 we sent noah to his nation he said i am a warner for you and a bearer of glad tidings
1126 worship none except allah i fear for you the punishment of a painful day
1127 the unbelieving council of his nation said we do not see you other than a human like ourselves we see your followers are none but the lowliest amongst us and their opinion is not to be considered we do not see you superior to us rather we consider you liars
1128 he said what do you think my nation if i have a clear proof from my lord and he has given me mercy from him though it is hidden from you can wecompel you to accept it when you hate it
1129 my nation for this i do not ask you for your wealth for my wage is only with allah nor will i drive away the believers for they will surely meet their lord but i can see that you are ignorant
1130 were i to drive you away my nation who would help me from allah will you not remember
1131 i do not say to you that i possess the treasuries of allah and i do not know the unseen i do not say i am an angel nor do i say to those whom you despise allah will not give them any good allah knows best what is in their hearts indeed if this were so then i would be amongst the harmdoers
1132 they said o noah you have disputed and disputed too much with us bring down upon us that which you promised us if what you say is true
1133 he replied allah will bring it down upon you if he will you will never frustrate him
1134 nor will my sincere counsel benefit you if i sincerely desire to counsel you if allah desires to lead you astray he is your lord and to him you shall return
1135 or do they say he has fabricated it himself say if i had fabricated it then the sin rests upon me i reject the sins you do
1136 and it was revealed to noah none of your nation will believe except whosoever has already believed do not distress yourself with what they may do
1137 build the ark with our seeing and protection and as we reveal do not speak to me concerning the evildoers they shall be drowned
1138 whenever an assembly of his nation passed by him as he was building the ark they mocked him whereupon he said if you mock us we shall indeedmock you just as you mock
1139 you shall know to whom a degrading punishment will come and upon whom an everlasting punishment will fall
1140 and when our command came and the oven gushed forth with water we said to noah take on board the ark a pair from every species and yourfamily except he of whom the word has already been spoken and those who believe and none except a few believed with him
1141 he noah said embark in the name of allah will be its course and berthing indeed my lord is forgiving the most merciful
1142 and so it the ark ran with them amidst the mountainous waves and noah cried out to his son who was standing apart embark with us my son do not be with the unbelievers
1143 but he replied i shall seek refuge on a mountain which will protect me from the water he noah said today there is no defender from the command of allah except those to whom he has mercy and the waves came between them and he was drowned
1144 and it was said earth swallow up your waters heaven cease the water subsided and the matter was accomplished and the ark came to rest upon the mountain of aljudi and it was said be gone evildoing nation
1145 noah called out to his lord saying o lord my son was of my family and your promise is surely the truth you are the most just of judges
1146 he said noah he is not of your family it is not a good deed do not ask me about things of which you have no knowledge i reproach you lest you become among the ignorant
1147 he said my lord i seek refuge with you from asking you of that which i have no knowledge if you do not forgive me and have mercy on me i shall be among the losers
1148 it was said o noah descend with peace from us and blessings on you and on the nations of those with you and nations we shall give them enjoyment and then from us they shall be visited with a painful punishment
1149 that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal to you neither you nor your nation knew this before now have patience the outcome is for the cautious
1150 to aad we sent their brother hood he said my nation worship allah you have no god except he you are only forgers
1151 my nation for this i ask of you no wage my wage is only with he who created me will you not understand
1152 my nation ask your lord to forgive you and turn to him in repentance from the sky he will loose an abundance of rain upon you he will add strength to your strength do not turn away as sinners
1153 they replied hood you have not brought us a clear sign we will not forsake our gods because of what you say we do not believe you
1154 we say nothing except our gods have afflicted you with some kind of evil he said i call allah to witness and you to bear witness that i reject what you associate
1155 other than him so all of you scheme against me then you shall give me no respite
1156 in truth i have put my trust in allah who is my lord and your lord there is no crawling creature that he does not take by the forelock indeed my lord is on a straight path
1157 if you turn away i have delivered to you that with which i was sent and my lord will cause people other than you to be your successors you cannot harm him a thing my lord is the guardian over every thing
1158 and when our command came we saved hood together with those who believed with him through our mercy and saved them from a harsh punishment
1159 such was aad they disbelieved the verses of their lord rebelled against his messengers and did the bidding of every rebellious tyrant
1160 they were overtaken by a curse in this world and they shall be cursed on the day of resurrection indeed aad disbelieved in their lord gone are aad the nation of hood
1161 and to thamood we sent their brother salih he said my nation worship allah you have no god except he it is he who made you from the earth and let you live upon it ask his forgiveness then repent to him indeed my lord is near and answers prayers
1162 they said salih before this you were a source of hope to us what would you now forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped indeed we are disquieted and doubt that to which you invite
1163 he said my nation think if i have a clear proof from my lord and he has given me his mercy who would help me against allah if i rebel against him indeed you would do nothing for me except increase my loss
1164 my nation this is the shecamel of allah a sign for you leave her to graze upon the earth of allah and do not touch her with evil lest you be seized by a punishment that is near
1165 yet they hamstrung her he salih said take your enjoyment in your homes for three days this is a promise that cannot be belied
1166 and when our command came we saved salih together with those who believed with him through our mercy and from the ignominy of that day yourlord is strong and mighty
1167 and the harmdoers were seized by the shout of the angel and in the morning they were found crouched in their dwellings dead
1168 as though they had never lived there indeed thamood disbelieved in their lord so begone thamood
1169 our messengers came to abraham with glad tidings they said peace he replied peace and in a while brought them a roasted calf
1170 but when he saw that their hands did not reach towards it he was wary and became fearful of them but they said do not be afraid we are sent to thenation of lot
1171 his wife sarah who was standing nearby laughed thereupon we gave her the good news of isaac and after isaac of jacob
1172 she replied alas for me shall i bear a child when i am old woman and my husband is advanced in years this is indeed a strange thing
1173 they said what do you marvel at the command of allah the mercy of allah and his blessings be upon you o people of the house indeed he ispraised exalted
1174 and when the wonderment departed from abraham and the glad tidings reached him he pleaded with us for the nation of lot
1175 indeed abraham was forbearing tenderhearted and penitent
1176 it was said abraham turn away from this your lords command has indeed come and there is coming upon them a punishment that will not be turned back
1177 and when our messengers came to lot he was troubled and distressed for them and said this is a harsh day
1178 his nation came running towards him whilst they were doing evil deeds my nation he said here are my daughters take them in marriage they are cleaner for you fear allah and do not humiliate me by my guests is there not one man amongst you of right mind
1179 they replied you know we have no right for your daughters you know very well what we desire
1180 he said would that i were powerful over you or might take refuge in a strong pillar
1181 they the angels said lot we are the messengers of your lord they shall not touch you depart with your family in the watch of the night and let none of you turn round except your wife she shall be struck by that which strikes them their appointed time is the morning is it not that the morning is near
1182 and when our command came we turned it upside down and rained on it stone after stone of baked clay
1183 marked with your lord and never far from the evildoers
1184 and to midian we sent their brother shuaib he said my nation worship allah you have no god except he do not reduce the measure nor the scale i see you are prosperous and fear the punishment of an encompassing day for you
1185 my nation be just in filling the measure and the scale do not reduce peoples goods and do not corrupt the land with mischief
1186 what remains with allah is better for you if you are believers i am not your guardian
1187 shuaib they replied does your prayer command you that we should abandon that which our fathers worshipped or do as we please with our goods you are clement and rightminded
1188 he said think my nation if i have a clear sign from my lord and he has provided me with good provision i do not desire to go behind you taking for myself that which i forbid you i seek but to reform as much as i can my help comes only from allah in him i have put my trust and to him i turn in penitence
1189 and my nation do not let your breaking with me bring upon you something similar to that which struck the nation of noah hood and salih and it is not long since the people of lot were punished
1190 ask the forgiveness of your lord and turn to him in repentance indeed my lord is the most merciful loving
1191 they said shuaib we do not understand much of what you say to us indeed we see you weak among us if it was not for your tribe we would have stoned you because you are not strong against us
1192 he said my nation is my tribe stronger against you than allah you have taken him to be thrown behind you my lord encompasses all that you do
1193 my nation do according to your position as i am doing and certainly you will know to whom the degrading punishment will come and who is a liar be watchful i shall be watching with you
1194 and when our command came we saved shuaib through our mercy together with those who believed then the evildoers were seized by a shout and when morning came they were crouched in their dwellings dead
1195 as if they had never have lived there begone the nation of midian just as thamood are gone
1196 we sent moses with our signs and with clear authority
1197 to pharaoh and his council but they followed the command of pharaoh and pharaohs command was not rightminded
1198 he shall go before his nation on the day of resurrection and lead them into the fire evil is the wateringplace to be led down to
1199 a curse was sent to follow them in this world and then upon them on the day of resurrection evil is the offering to be offered
11100 that which we have related to you is the news of the villages some of them still stand whereas others are stubble
11101 we did not wrong them rather they wronged themselves their gods that they called upon other than allah did not help them when your lords command came they did not increased them except in their destruction
11102 such is the seizing of your lord when he seizes the evildoing villages his seizing is painful stern
11103 indeed for he who fears the punishment of the everlasting life that is a sign that is a day on which everyone shall be assembled that shall be a witnessed day
11104 we shall not postpone it except until a counted term
11105 when that day arrives no soul shall speak except by his permission some shall be wretched and others happy
11106 the wretched shall be cast in the fire where they will moan and sigh
11107 and there they shall live for ever as long as the heavens and the earth endure and as your lord wills indeed your lord accomplishes whatsoever he will
11108 as for the happy they shall live in paradise for ever so as long as the heavens and the earth endure and as your lord wills an unbroken gift
11109 therefore do no be doubtful as to what these worship they worship only that which their fathers worshiped before them we shall indeed pay them in full their undiminished measure
11110 we gave moses the book but they differed regarding it but for a word that preceded from your lord it had been decided between them and they are indisquieting doubt of it
11111 indeed your lord will pay each one of them in full for their deeds he is aware of the things they do
11112 so you and whosoever repents with you go straight as you have been commanded and do not be insolent indeed he sees what you do
11113 and do not incline to the wrongdoers lest you are touched by the fire for then you shall not be helped you have no guardians other than allah
11114 and establish your prayer at the two edges of the day and in part of the night good deeds will repel evil deeds that is a remembrance for those whoremember
11115 therefore have patience allah will not let the wage of the gooddoers go to waste
11116 if only there had been except for a few among them whom we saved among the generations that have gone before you some that remained forbidding corruption in the land but the wrongdoers pursued the ease they had been given to delight in and became sinners
11117 your lord would never destroy the villages unjustly whilst their people were reforming
11118 had your lord willed he would have made mankind a single nation but they continue in their differences
11119 except those on whom your lord shows mercy for this end he has created them the word of your lord shall be perfectly completed i shall fillgehenna hell with jinn and people all together
11120 and all we relate to you of the tidings of the messengers is that whereby we strengthen your heart and through these the truth has come to you and anadmonition and a reminder to the believers
11121 say to those who disbelieve do according to your station we are doing according to our station
11122 wait we too are waiting
11123 to allah belongs the unseen in the heavens and in the earth to him the matter in its entirety shall be returned worship him and put your trust in him your lord is not inattentive of the things you do
121 aliflaamra those are the verses of the clear book
122 we have sent it down an arabic koran in order that you understand
123 in the sending down of this koran we will narrate to you prophet muhammad the best of narratives of which you were previously unaware
124 when joseph said to his father father i saw eleven planets and the sun and the moon i saw them prostrating themselves before me
125 he said o my son say nothing of this vision to your brothers lest they should cunningly plot against you indeed satan is the clear enemy of the human
126 so your lord will choose you and teach you the interpretation of visions and perfect his favor upon you and upon the house of jacob as he perfected it on your fathers abraham and isaac before you your lord is knowing wise
127 indeed in joseph and his brothers there were signs for those who inquire
128 they said joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than ourselves even though we are many truly our father is obviously wrong
129 let us kill joseph or cast him away in some far off land so that your fathers face will be left for you and afterwards you will be a righteous nation
1210 one of them said no do not kill joseph if you do anything cast him into a dark pit a traveler will pick him up
1211 they said father what is the matter with you do you not trust us with joseph indeed we are sincere advisors
1212 send him with us tomorrow to frolic and play we will look after him
1213 he said it grieves me to let him go with you for i fear lest the wolf should devour him when you are not paying attention to him
1214 they said we are many if a wolf devours him then we are losers
1215 when they went with him they agreed to put him in the bottom of a well we revealed to him you shall tell them of what they did when they are not aware it is you
1216 at nightfall they returned weeping to their father
1217 they said we went racing and left joseph with our things the wolf devoured him but you will not believe us though we speak the truth
1218 and they brought his shirt stained with blood a lie he said no your souls have tempted you to do something but come sweet patience the help ofallah is always there to seek against that which you describe
1219 thereafter travelers came and sent their waterman and when he had let down his pail he cried rejoice a boy then they concealed him among their merchandise but allah knew what they did
1220 then they sold him for a trifling price a number of dirhams because they considered him to be of little value
1221 the egyptian that bought him said to his wife make his stay honorable he may benefit us or take him for our son as such we established joseph in the land so that we might teach him the interpretation of visions allah prevails in his affairs though most people do not know
1222 and when he reached maturity we bestowed on him judgment and knowledge as such we recompense those who do good
1223 and she in whose house he was sought to seduce him and closed the doors saying come in allah is my refuge he replied my lord has made my dwelling a good one harmdoers never prosper
1224 she desired him had he not been shown the proof of his lord he would have taken her but we turned him away from evil and abomination for he was one of our sincere worshipers
1225 they raced to the door and she tore his shirt from behind and by the door they met her husband whereupon she said what is the recompense of one whose intent is evil against your people other than being imprisoned or sternly punished
1226 he joseph said it was she who sought to seduce me and a witness an infant of her people bore witness saying if his shirt is torn from the front she is speaking the truth and he is one of the liars
1227 but if his shirt is torn from behind she lied and he is of the truthful
1228 and when he saw his shirt torn at the back he said this is one of your womens guiles your guile o woman is great indeed
1229 joseph turn away from this and you ask forgiveness for your sin you are indeed one of the sinners
1230 certain women in the city said the governors wife has sought to seduce her servant he has made her heart stricken with love for him clearly we perceive her to be in error
1231 when she heard of their sly whispers she sent for them and prepared a banquet to each she gave a knife then called joseph saying come and attend to them when they saw him they were so taken with him that they cut their hands and said allah save us this is no mortal he is no other but a noble angel
1232 whereupon she said now you see this is he on whose account you blamed me yes i sought to seduce him but he was unyielding if he declines to do what i command he shall be imprisoned and be one of the humiliated
1233 he supplicated lord prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me yet if you do not shield me from their guile i shall yield to them and be one of the ignorant
1234 his lord answered him and he turned their guile away from him indeed he is the hearer the knower
1235 then it seemed good to them even after they had seen the signs that they should imprison him for some time
1236 two young men went to prison with him one of them said i saw in a vision that i was pressing grapes and the other said i saw in a vision that i was carrying bread upon my head and that birds ate of it tell us its interpretation for we can see you are among the good
1237 he said before any food comes to feed either of you i will give you its interpretation that which i will tell you has been taught to me by allah i reject the belief of a nation who do not believe in allah and disbelieve in the everlasting life
1238 i follow the creed of my fathers abraham isaac and jacob it is not for us to associate anything with allah such is the favor of allah to us and to mankind yet most people do not give thanks
1239 my fellowprisoners say which is better many gods at variance or allah the one the conqueror
1240 that which you worship other than him are nothing but names which you and your fathers have named and for which allah has sent down no authority judgement rests with allah alone he has commanded you to worship none except him that is the right religion yet most people do not know
1241 my fellowprisoners one of you will pour wine for his lord whereas the other will be crucified and birds will peck at his head the matter you inquired about has been decided
1242 and he said to the one of the two who he knew would be saved mention me in the presence of your lord but satan made him forget to mention him to his master so that he remained in prison for a certain number years
1243 the king said i saw in a vision seven fatted cows being devoured by seven lean ones and seven green ears of corn and seven others withered my counselors tell me the meaning of my vision if you can interpret visions
1244 they said they are confused nightmares nor do we know anything of the interpretation of visions
1245 after all that time the one of the two who had been saved remembered he said i will interpret it for you so let me go
1246 he said joseph the truthful tell us of the seven fatted cows that were devoured by seven lean ones also of the seven green ears of corn and the other seven which were withered so that i can go back to the people and then they will then know
1247 he replied you shall sow for seven years as is your way leave in the ear of corn you reap except a little which you eat
1248 thereafter seven hard years will come upon you which will consume all but little of that which you have stored
1249 then there will come a year in which people are helped in which the people will press
1250 the king said bring him before me but when the kings envoy came to him he said go back to your lord and ask him what about the women who cut their hands indeed my lord knows their guile
1251 what was your business women he asked when you solicited joseph allah save us they replied we know no evil against him the governors wife said the truth has been discovered at last i solicited him he is among the truthful
1252 this i have done so that he will know i did not secretly betray him and that allah does not guide the guile of the treacherous
1253 yet i do not consider my soul was innocent surely the soul incites to evil except to whom my lord has mercy indeed my lord is forgiving the mostmerciful
1254 the king said bring him before me i will assign him to myself and when he had spoken with him he said today you are firmly established in both our favor and trust
1255 he joseph said give me charge of the storehouses of the land i am a knowledgeable guardian
1256 and as such we established joseph in the land to live wherever he liked we bestow our mercy on whom we will and we never waste the wage of therighteous
1257 indeed the reward of the everlasting life is better for those who believe and are cautious
1258 josephs brothers came and presented themselves before him he recognized them but they did not know him
1259 and when he had given them their provisions he said bring me a certain brother from your father do you not see that i give just measure and am the bestof hosts
1260 if you do not bring him to me you shall receive no measure of corn from me nor shall you come near me again
1261 they replied we will ask our father for him this we will surely do
1262 then he said to his attendants put their merchandise in their saddlebags hopefully they will recognize it when they return to their people perhaps they will come back
1263 when they returned to their father they said father we have been denied the measure send our brother with us and we shall receive our measure we will indeed look after him
1264 he replied am i to trust you with him as i once trusted you with his brother why allah is the best of guardians and he is the most merciful of themerciful
1265 when they opened their saddlebags they found that their merchandise had been given back to them father they said what more do we desire look our merchandise has been returned to us we will receive provisions for our family and we will look after our brother we shall receive an extra camelload that is an easy measure
1266 he replied i will never send him with you until you swear by allah that you will bring him back to me unless you are prevented and when they had given him their oath he said allah is the guardian of what we say
1267 then he said my sons do not enter from one gate enter through different gates i cannot be of any help to you against allah judgement belongs to allah alone in him i have put my trust in him let all put their trust
1268 and when they entered from where their father had instructed them nothing helped them against the decree of allah it was but a need in jacobs soul which he had fulfilled he possessed knowledge because of what we had taught him though most people do not know
1269 when they presented themselves before joseph he took his brother in his arms and said i am your brother do not grieve at what they did
1270 and when he had given them their provisions he hid a drinkingcup in his brothers saddlebag then a herald called out after them cameleers you are thieves
1271 they turned back and asked what have you lost
1272 we are missing the goblet of the king he replied whosoever restores it shall have a camelload that i guarantee
1273 by allah they said you know we did not come to do evil in this land we are not thieves
1274 they said what shall be the recompense if you prove to be lying
1275 they replied its recompense in whosoevers saddle bag it is found he shall be its recompense as such we punish the harmdoers
1276 he searched their bags before his brothers and then took out the goblet from his brothers bag as such we directed joseph by the kings law he had no right to seize his brother unless allah willed otherwise we raise whom we will in rank over every knowledgeable person is one who knows
1277 they said if he is a thief know then that a brother of his has committed theft before him but joseph kept it secret and did not reveal it to them he saidyou are in a worse position and allah knows well what you describe
1278 they said mighty prince his father is old advanced in years take one of us instead of him we can see you are amongst the gooddoers
1279 he replied allah forbid that we should seize any but he with whom our property was found for then we should be harmdoers
1280 when they despaired of him they went in private to confer together the eldest said do you not know that your father took a pledge from you in the name of allah and that you failed before regarding joseph i shall never stir from this land until my father gives me leave or allah makes known to me his judgement he is the best of judges
1281 return all of you to your father and say to him father your son has committed a theft we testify only to what we know how could we guard against the unforeseen
1282 ask the village where we were and the caravan in which we traveled we speak the truth
1283 no he jacob said your souls have tempted you to do something but come sweet patience allah may bring them all to me he alone is the knowing the wise
1284 and he turned away and said alas for joseph his eyes turned white with the grief he repressed within him
1285 they said by allah will you not cease to mention joseph until you are consumed or are among the perishing
1286 he replied i complain to allah of my anguish and sadness i know from allah what you do not know
1287 go and seek news of joseph and his brother do not despair of the comfort of allah none but unbelievers despair of the comfort of allah
1288 and when they presented themselves before him they said o mighty prince we and our people are afflicted with distress we have brought but little merchandise fill up the measure and be charitable to us allah rewards the charitable
1289 do you know he replied what you did to joseph and his brother in your ignorance
1290 they said are you joseph i am joseph he answered and this is my brother allah has been gracious to us those who keep from evil and are patient indeed allah does not let the wage of the good doers go to waste
1291 by allah they said allah has preferred you above us all we have indeed been sinful
1292 he replied let no reproach be on you this day allah will forgive you he is the most merciful of the merciful
1293 go take this shirt of mine and cast it over my fathers face he will recover his sight then return to me with all your family
1294 as the caravan departed their father said i smell the scent of joseph unless you think i am foolish
1295 by allah they said this is but your old illusion
1296 and when the bearer of glad tidings arrived he laid josephs shirt over him and he saw once again he said did i not tell you that i know from allah what you do not know
1297 his sons said father ask forgiveness for our sins we have indeed been sinners
1298 he said i shall ask my lord to forgive you he is forgiving the most merciful
1299 and when they entered before joseph he took his father and mother into his arms and said welcome to egypt safe if allah wills
12100 he lifted his parents to the throne and the others bowed before him joseph said to his father this is the meaning of my vision of long ago my lord has verified it he has been gracious to me he brought me out of prison and brought you out of the desert after satan had corrupted the relationship between me and my brothers my lord is gentle to whom he will he alone is the knower the wise
12101 lord you have given me the kingdom and taught me to interpret visions originator of the heavens and the earth my guardian in this world and in the everlasting life let me die in submission as a muslim and let me join the righteous
12102 that is of the news we reveal to you of the unseen you were not present when they agreed upon their plan scheming
12103 even though you are so eager most people will not believe
12104 you shall ask no wage for it it is nothing except a reminder to all mankind
12105 how many signs in the heavens and earth do they pass by and turn away from
12106 and most of them do not believe in allah but they associate others with him
12107 do they feel secure that the punishment of allah will envelop them or that the hour will overtake them suddenly when they are unaware
12108 say this is my path i call to allah with sure knowledge i and my followers exaltations be to allah i am not among the idolaters
12109 we did not send any before you from the inhabitants of the village but men to whom a revelation was sent have they not traveled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them better is the dwelling in the everlasting life for those who keep from evil do you not understand
12110 and when at length our messengers despaired and reckoned that they would be belied our help came down to them saving whom we pleased ourmight cannot be withheld from the guilty nation
12111 indeed in their stories is a lesson for those of understanding this is no forged tale rather it is a confirmation of the previous a distinguishing of all things a guidance and a mercy to a nation who believe
131 aliflaammeemra those are the verses of the book that which is sent down to you prophet muhammad from your lord is the truth yet most people do not believe
132 it is allah who raised the heavens without pillars that you see then he willed to the throne and subjected the sun and the moon each pursuing an appointed course he directs the affair he makes plain his verses so that you will firmly believe in meeting your lord
133 it is he who stretched out the earth and placed upon it firm mountains and rivers and of all fruits he has put in it two pairs and drew the veil of night over the day surely in these there are signs for a nation who think
134 and in the land there are adjoining plots gardens of vines sown fields and palmtrees in pairs and single that are watered with one water yet we make some excel others in produce surely in that are signs for a nation who understand
135 if you would wonder then wondrous is their saying when we are dust shall we be raised to life again a new creation such are those who disbelieve in their lord their necks shall be fettered they shall be the inhabitants of the fire in it they shall live for ever
136 they bid you to hasten the evil before the good yet examples have passed away before them your lord is forgiving to people despite their evildoing yet your lord is stern in retribution
137 the unbelievers say why has no sign been sent down to him from his lord you are only a warner and there is a guide for every nation
138 allah knows what every female bears and what shrinks and swells the womb and everything with him has its measure
139 he is the knower of the unseen and the seen the great the exalted
1310 similar to yourself is he who conceals his saying and he who proclaims it he who hides himself in the night and he who goes forth by day
1311 he has attendant angels before him and behind him who by the command of allah watch over him allah does not change what is in a nation unless they change what is in themselves whenever allah wants evil for a nation none can ward it off other than him they have no guardian
1312 it is he who shows you the lightning for fear and hope and who produces laden clouds
1313 the thunder exalts his praise and so are the angels are in awe of him he looses the thunderbolts and smites whosoever he will yet they dispute aboutallah who is mighty in power
1314 to him is the call of truth those to whom they call other than him give them no answer they are like he who stretches out his hands to the water andbids it rise to his mouth it does not reach it the prayers of the unbelievers goes astray
1315 all who dwell in the heavens and earth shall prostrate themselves before allah either willingly or unwillingly as do their shadows in the mornings andevenings
1316 say who is the lord of the heavens and the earth say allah say why then have you chosen guardians other than him even though they have neither the power to benefit nor harm themselves say are the blind and the seeing equal are darkness and light equal or have they ascribed to allah associates who create as he creates so that all creation is alike to them say allah is the creator of everything he is the one the conqueror
1317 he sends down water from the sky and the valleys wadis flow each in their measure and the torrent carries a swelling scum and fire from that which they kindle desiring ornament or ware from that rises a scum like it as such allah strikes both the truth and the false as for the scum it is cast away as jetsam but that which profits people remains on the earth as such allah strikes the parables
1318 for those who answer their lord is a most fine reward but for those who do not answer him if they possessed all that the earth contains and as much besides they would offer it for their ransom theirs shall be an evil reckoning gehenna hell shall be their refuge an evil cradling
1319 then is he who knows what is sent down to you from your lord is the truth like he who is blind indeed only those possessed with minds remember
1320 who fulfill their promise to allah and do not break their pledge
1321 who join together what allah has bidden to be united who fear their lord and dread the evil reckoning
1322 patient men desiring the face of their lord establish their prayers and spend of what we have given them in private and in public and who wardoff evil with good theirs shall be the ultimate abode
1323 they shall enter the gardens of eden together with the righteous among their fathers their wives and their descendants from every gate the angels will come to them
1324 peace be to you for that you were patient best is the ultimate abode
1325 as for those who break the covenant of allah after accepting it who part what he has commanded to be united and worked corruption in the land a curse shall be laid on them and they shall have an evil abode
1326 allah gives abundantly and sparingly to whom he will they rejoice in this present life but this present life beside the everlasting life is nothing but a passing enjoyment
1327 and those who disbelieve say why has no sign been sent down to him by his lord say allah leads astray whom he will and guides those who repent
1328 those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of allah is it not with the remembrance of allah that hearts are satisfied
1329 for those who believe and do good works is blessedness and blessed resort
1330 as such we have sent you forth to a nation before whom others have passed away in order that you recite to them what we have revealed to you yet they disbelieve the merciful say he is my lord there is no god except he in him i have put my trust and to him i turn
1331 if only a koran whereby the mountains were set in motion or the earth cleaved asunder or the dead spoken to no but to allah is the affair altogether do those who believe know that had allah willed he could have guided all people as for those who disbelieve because of what they do disaster will not cease to afflict them or it alights near their home until the promise of allah comes allah will not break his promise
1332 other messengers were mocked before you but i respited the unbelievers then i seized them and how was my retribution
1333 what he who stands over every soul for what it has earned yet they made partners for allah say name them or would you tell him of that which is unknown in the earth to him or in outward speech only indeed their devising seems fair to the unbelievers for they are barred from the right way none can guide those whom allah leads astray
1334 they shall be punished in this life but the punishment of the everlasting life is more grievous none shall defend them from allah
1335 the likeness of paradise which the righteous have been promised beneath it rivers flow its produce and shade are eternal such is the payment of the righteous but the payment of the unbelievers is the fire
1336 those to whom we have given the book rejoice in what is sent down to you while some factions reject a part of it say i am commanded to worship allah and to associate none with him to him i supplicate and to him i turn
1337 and as such we have sent it down an arabic judgment and if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you you shall have no guardian other than allah nor yet a defender
1338 we have sent forth other messengers before you and given them wives and descendants yet none of them could bring a sign except by the permission of allah every term has its book
1339 allah blots out and he establishes what he will with him is the essence of the book
1340 whether we show you part of that we promise them or we call you to us it is only for you to deliver the message and ours is the accounting
1341 do they not see how we come to the land and reduce its extremities allah judges none repel his judgement swift is his reckoning
1342 those who have gone before them devised but to allah is the devising altogether he knows what every soul earns the unbelievers shall know without doubt for whom is the ultimate abode
1343 those who disbelieve say you are not a messenger say allah is a sufficient witness between me and you and whosoever possess knowledge of the book
141 aliflaamra we have sent down to you this book in order that you bring mankind from darkness to the light by the permission of your lord to the path of the almighty the praised
142 allah to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth woe to the unbelievers for a terrible punishment
143 those who prefer this life more than the everlasting life and bar others from the way of allah and seek to make it crooked they are in far error
144 we have sent no messenger except in the tongue of his own nation so that he might make everything plain to them but allah leads astray whom he will and guides whom he will he is the almighty the wise
145 we sent moses with our signs bring your nation out of darkness into the light and remind them of the days of allah surely in that are signs for every patient thankful person
146 moses said to his nation remember the blessing of allah to you when he saved you from pharaohs family who had oppressed you cruelly and who slew your sons and spared your women surely that was a great trial from your lord
147 and when your lord proclaimed if you give thanks i will increase you but if you are unthankful my punishment is indeed stern
148 and moses said if you and all mankind are thankless he is surely rich praised
149 have you not heard what befell the nations that have gone before you the nations of noah aad and thamood and those who came after none knows them but allah their messengers came to them with clear signs but they thrust their hands into their mouths and said without doubt we disbelieve the message you have been sent with that which you call us to is disquieting
1410 their messengers said is there any doubt about allah the originator of the heavens and the earth he calls you to him in order that he forgives you your sins and defers you till a stated term they said you are only mortals like us you wish to bar us from that which our fathers worshipped give us some clear proof
1411 their messengers said to them we are nothing except humans like you but allah bestows his mercy on those of his worshipers whom he chooses we cannot give you proof except with the permission of allah in allah let believers put their trust
1412 and why should we not put our trust in allah when he has already guided us to our paths we will endure your hurt patiently in allah let all who trust place their trust
1413 those who disbelieved said to their messengers return to our faith or we will banish you from our land but allah revealed to them we shall destroy the harmdoers
1414 and let you live in the land after them this is for him who fears my station and fears my threat
1415 they sought a judgment then every tyrant was disappointed
1416 gehenna hell is before him and he is given oozing pus to drink
1417 which he gulps and can scarcely swallow death will come to him from every side yet he cannot not die and yet to come is a dreadful punishment
1418 as for the likeness of those who disbelieve in their lord their works are like ashes which a strong wind scatters on a stormy day they are powerless over that they have earned that is the far error
1419 do you not see that allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth he can put you away if he will and bring into being a new creation
1420 indeed that is no great thing for allah
1421 together they shall all come before allah then the weak will say to those who were proud we were your followers can you help us in anything against the punishment of allah they will say had allah guided us we would have guided you it is now the same for us whether we cannot endure or bear patiently we have no place of refuge
1422 and when the issue has been decided satan will say to them the promise which allah made you was true i promised you but failed to keep it i had no authority over you except that i called you and you answered me do not bame me rather blame yourselves i cannot help you nor can you help me i disbelieved in your associating me with allah before indeed for the evildoers there is a painful punishment
1423 as for those who believe and do good works they shall be admitted to gardens underneath which rivers flow in which by the permission of their lord they shall live for ever their greeting shall be peace
1424 have you not seen how allah sets forth a parable that a good deed is like a good tree its roots are firm and its branches are in the heaven
1425 yielding its fruit every season by the permission of allah allah gives parables to mankind so that they might remember
1426 the likeness of a corrupt word is like a corrupt tree uprooted from the earth having no stability
1427 allah will strengthen the believers with a steadfast word both in this life and in the everlasting life allah leads the evildoers astray allah does what he will
1428 have you not seen those who exchanged the favor of allah with disbelief and landed their nation in a house of ruin
1429 they shall be roasted in gehenna an evil establishment
1430 they set up rivals with allah to lead others astray say to them take your pleasure your arrival shall be the fire
1431 tell my worshippers those who believe who establish the prayer and spend of what we have given them in private and in public before the coming of that day in which there is neither bargaining nor the taking of friends
1432 it is allah who created the heavens and the earth and sends down water from the heaven with which he brings forth fruits for your provision he has subjected to you ships which by his command run upon the sea he has subjected to you rivers
1433 and he subjected to you the sun and the moon which are constant in their courses and he has subjected to you the night and the day and gave you all that you asked of him
1434 if you count the blessings of allah you will never number them indeed the human is wicked and thankless
1435 and when abraham said my lord make this a land secure turn me and my children away from worshipping idols
1436 my lord they have led many people astray whosoever follows me belongs to me whosoever rebels against me you are surely forgiving the mostmerciful
1437 our lord i have settled some of my offspring in a barren valley near your holy house our lord in order that they establish the prayer make the hearts of people yearn towards them and provide them with fruits in order that they are thankful
1438 our lord you have knowledge of all that we hide and all that we reveal nothing in heaven or earth is hidden from allah
1439 praise be to allah who has given me ishmael and isaac in my old age indeed my lord is the hearer of the supplication
1440 my lord make me and my descendants establishers of prayer our lord accept my prayer
1441 forgive me our lord and forgive my parents and all the believers on the day of reckoning
1442 do not think that allah is unaware of the harmdoers work he only gives them respite till the day on which all eyes will stare
1443 when they shall run with their necks outstretched and heads erect their glances never return to themselves their hearts are empty
1444 warn mankind of the day when the punishment will overtake them when the evildoers will say our lord grant us respite for awhile we will answer your call and follow the messengers did you not once swear that you would never cease
1445 you lived in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves and it was clear to you how we dealt with them and how we struck parables for you
1446 they plotted their plots but their plots are known to allah even though their plots were such as to move mountains
1447 do not think that allah will break the promise he gave to his messengers mighty is allah and vengeful
1448 on the day when the earth is changed into other than the earth and the heavens all shall come before allah the one the conqueror
1449 on that day you shall see the sinners coupled together in fetters
1450 their garments shall be of melted tar and their faces enveloped by the fire
1451 allah will recompense each soul according to its earnings swift is the reckoning of allah
1452 this is a message to be delivered to mankind so that they may be warned by it and know that he is allah one god and so all those possessed of minds may remember
151 aliflaamra those are the verses of the book the clear koran
152 it could be that those who disbelieve will wish that they were muslims
153 let them eat and enjoy and let their hopes deceive them soon they shall know
154 we never destroyed a village whose term had not already been decreed
155 no nation can outstrip its term nor do they put it back
156 they say you to whom the remembrance is sent down you are indeed mad
157 why do you not bring down the angels if what you say is true
158 we do not send angels except with the truth then they shall have no respite
159 it is we who sent down the koran and we watch over it
1510 we have sent forth before you messengers among the factions of the ancients
1511 but no messenger came to them except he was mocked
1512 so we make it enter the hearts of the sinners
1513 they do not believe in it even though the practice of the ancients has already gone
1514 if we opened a gate in the heaven and they kept ascending through it
1515 still they would say our eyes were dazzled truly we must have been a bewitched people
1516 we have set constellations in the heavens and made them pleasing to the beholders
1517 and guarded them from every stoned satan
1518 except for he who steals the listening and is then pursued by a visible flame
1519 we have spread out the earth and set upon it firm mountains everything we have caused to grow therein is justly weighed
1520 and there appointed for you is a livelihood and for those you do not provide
1521 and there is not a thing but with us are its treasuries and we do not send it down except in a known measure
1522 we send the winds fertilizing and we send down out of heaven water from which you drink and you are not its treasurers
1523 and surely it is we who give life and make to die we are the inheritor
1524 we know those of you who press forward and we know the laggards
1525 and it is your lord who will gather them he is wise knowing
1526 we created mankind from clay molded from mud
1527 and before him we created the jinn from smokeless fire
1528 when your lord said to the angels see i am creating a mortal from clay of molded mud
1529 when i have shaped him and ran my created soul in him fall down prostrating towards him
1530 all the angels prostrated themselves
1531 except iblis father of the jinn who refused to be one of those who prostrated themselves
1532 he said iblis what is the matter with you that you do you not prostrate yourself
1533 he replied i will not prostrate to a mortal you have created of clay from molded mud
1534 allah said begone you are accursed
1535 a curse shall be on you till the day of recompense
1536 he said my lord reprieve me till the day they are raised
1537 he answered you are among those reprieved
1538 till the appointed time
1539 satan said my lord for your perverting me i shall make matters in the earth seem most fair to them and i shall pervert all
1540 except the devoted amongst your worshippers
1541 he allah said this is for me the right path
1542 over my worshipers you have no authority except the perverse that follow you
1543 gehenna hell will be the promise for all of them
1544 it has seven gates and through each gate a portion of them belong
1545 but the cautious shall live amongst gardens and fountains
1546 in peace and security enter them
1547 we shall remove all rancor from their hearts and as brethren they shall recline on couches face to face
1548 there no fatigue shall smite them nor shall they ever be driven from it
1549 tell my worshipers that i am the forgiving the most merciful
1550 and that my punishment is the painful chastisement
1551 tell them of abrahams guests
1552 they entered to him and said peace but he replied we are afraid of you
1553 do not be afraid they answered we come to give you glad tidings of a knowledgeable child
1554 he said what is this do you bring me glad tidings even though i am old of what do you give me glad tidings
1555 they replied in truth we have given you glad tidings do not be one of those who despair
1556 he replied and who despairs of the mercy of his lord except those that are astray
1557 he asked messengers what is your errand
1558 they replied we are sent to sinful nation
1559 except lots family of whom we shall save all
1560 but his wife we decreed that she should be amongst those who remain behind
1561 and when the envoys came to the family of lot
1562 he said to them i do not know you
1563 no they replied we bring you news of that concerning which they were doubting
1564 we bring you the truth and indeed we are truthful
1565 depart with your family in a part of the night and walk behind them and let none of you turn round go to a place where you are commanded
1566 and we made known to him this decree that the wrongdoers were to be utterly cut off in the morning
1567 the people of the city came to him rejoicing
1568 he said these are my guests do not shame me
1569 fear allah and do not disgrace me
1570 they replied have we not forbidden you the people of the worlds
1571 he said here are my daughters take them in marriage if you would be doing
1572 by your life they wandered blindly in their dazzlement
1573 at sunrise a dreadful shout seized them
1574 we laid it the city upside down and rained stones of baked clay upon them
1575 surely in that there are signs for those who contemplate
1576 indeed it is on a way which still exists
1577 surely in that there is a sign for those who believe
1578 the dwellers of the thicket were harmdoers
1579 on them too we took vengeance and they are both on a clear roadway
1580 and the dwellers of al hijr also belied the messengers
1581 we brought them signs but they turned away
1582 they hewed their dwellings out of the mountains in safety
1583 but the shout seized them in the morning
1584 and that which they had earned did not help them
1585 we did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them except in truth the hour is sure to come therefore forgive them with a graciouspardon
1586 your lord is the creator the knower
1587 we have given you the seven dual verses al fatihah and the mighty holy reading koran
1588 do not stretch your eyes to that we have given pairs of them to enjoy nor sorrow for them and lower your wing to the believers
1589 and say i am the plain warner
1590 so we sent it down to the partitioners
1591 who have broken the koran into parts
1592 so by your lord we will question them all
1593 about what they did
1594 proclaim then what you are commanded and turn away from the unbelievers
1595 we suffice you against those who mock
1596 and those who set up other gods with allah indeed they will soon know
1597 indeed we know your chest is straitened by that they say
1598 exalt with the praise of your lord and be one of those who prostrate
1599 worship your lord till the certainty death comes to you
161 the command of allah will surely come do not seek to hasten it highly exalted is he above that they associate with him
162 he sends down the angels with the spirit gabriel by his command to those of his worshipers whom he chooses saying warn there is no god except me therefore fear me
163 he created the heavens and the earth with truth exalted is he above what they associate with him
164 he created mankind from a sperm drop yet he is a clear adversary
165 and the cattle he created for you in them you have warmth and other uses and of them you eat
166 in them there is beauty for you when you bring them home and when you lead them to pasture
167 they carry your loads to a land which you could not otherwise reach except by painful toil to oneself your lord is the clement the most merciful
168 he has created for you horses mules and donkeys which you ride and as an adornment and he creates what you do not know
169 it is for allah to show the way some swerve from it but had he willed he would have guided all of you
1610 it is he who sends down water from heaven which provides drink for you and brings forth trees on which your herds feed
1611 and thereby he brings forth crops and olives palms and vines and all the fruits surely in this there is a sign for a nation who think
1612 he has subjected to you the night the day the sun and the moon the stars are subjected by his command surely in that there is a sign for a nation who understands
1613 and what he has multiplied for you in the earth is of various hues surely in that there is a sign for a nation who remember
1614 it is he who has subjected the sea to you so that you eat of its soft flesh and bring up from it ornaments which you wear and you see the ships plowingtheir course through it in order that you seek his bounty and give thanks
1615 he set firm mountains upon the earth lest it should shake with you and rivers and roads in order that you are guided
1616 and waymarks and by the star they are guided
1617 is he who creates as he who does not create will you not remember
1618 if you count the favors of allah you could not number them indeed allah is forgiving and the most merciful
1619 allah has knowledge of all that you hide and all that you reveal
1620 but those whom you invoke other than allah do not create anything they are themselves created
1621 they are dead not living and they do not know when they will be raised to life
1622 your god is one god those who do not believe in the everlasting life their hearts disbelieve and are puffed up with pride
1623 allah knows without doubt what they hide and what they make known he does not love the proud
1624 and if they are asked what has your lord revealed they say tales of the ancients fairytales
1625 they shall carry their sins completely on the day of resurrection and some of the sins of those who were led astray by them without knowledge evil is that which they sin
1626 those who have gone before them also plotted then allah came upon their building from the foundations and the roof fell down on them from above them and the punishment overtook them from where they did not know
1627 he will degrade them on the day of resurrection he will say where are my partners for whose sake you opposed and those to whom knowledge has been given will say degradation today and evil are on the unbelievers
1628 whom the angels take while they were still harming themselves then they will offer submission saying we have done no evil no surely allah knows what you have done
1629 enter the gates of gehenna hell to be in it for ever evil is the lodging of the proud
1630 it is said to the cautious what has your lord revealed they will reply good for those who did good in this world is goodness indeed the lodging in the everlasting life is better an excellent dwelling for the cautious
1631 they shall enter the gardens of eden under which rivers flow and there they shall have all they desire so allah recompenses the cautious
1632 whom the angels take while they are goodly saying peace be on you enter paradise for what you were doing
1633 are they looking for the angels to come down or the order of your lord to come as such did those who have gone before them allah did not wrong them but they wronged themselves
1634 so the evil things which they did coiled around them and they were encompassed by that they mocked
1635 the idolaters say had allah willed neither we nor our fathers would have worshipped anything other than him nor would we have forbidden anything without him as such did those before them yet what should messengers do but give a clear deliverance
1636 we sent a messenger to every nation saying worship allah and avoid the idols amongst them were some whom allah guided and some justly disposed to error travel in the land and see what was the end of those who belied the revelation and the prophets
1637 though you are ever so eager to guide them allah will not guide those who mislead others there shall be none to help them
1638 they solemnly swear by allah that allah will never raise the dead to life no surely the promise of allah is binding upon him though most people do not know
1639 this is in order that he may make clear to them that which they differed upon and in order that those who disbelieve might know that they were indeed lying
1640 when we decree a thing we only say be and it is
1641 and those who after they have been wronged emigrated for the cause of allah we will lodge them with a good life in this world but greater still is the wage of the everlasting life if they but knew
1642 such are those who are patient and put their trust in their lord
1643 we never sent but men before you to whom we revealed ask the people of the remembrance if you do not know
1644 we sent them with clear signs and the psalms and we sent down to you the remembrance so that you can make clear to people what has been sent down to them in order that they reflect
1645 do those who do evil feel secure that allah will not make the earth to swallow them or that the punishment will not fall upon them from where they do not know
1646 or that he will not seize them in their going to and fro and they will not be able to frustrate him
1647 or that he will not seize them a little at a time and destroy them indeed your lord is clement the most merciful
1648 do they not see how every thing allah created casts its shadow right and left prostrating itself before allah in all humility
1649 everything in the heavens and every crawling creature on earth and the angels prostrate to allah and they are not proud
1650 they fear their lord from above them and do as they are commanded
1651 allah says do not take to yourself two gods he is only one god so have awe of me
1652 to him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth his is the religion for ever would you then fear any but allah
1653 whatever favor you have is from allah whenever you are afflicted you groan to him
1654 when he removes your affliction then some of you set up associates to their lord
1655 that they may show ingratitude for what we gave them so take your pleasure you shall soon know
1656 they set aside a share of that which we have provided them for what they did not know by allah you shall be questioned about your forgeries
1657 they ascribe daughters to allah exaltations to him but they themselves would have what they desire
1658 when good news of the birth of a female is given to any of them his face grows dark and inwardly he chokes
1659 because of the evil of the good news he hides himself from people pondering whether he will keep her and be humiliated or trample her into the dust evil is their judgement
1660 those who do not believe in the everlasting life theirs is the evil likeness and for allah is the highest likeness he is the mighty the wise
1661 if allah punished people for their sins he would not leave one creature that crawls on the earth he reprieves them to an appointed term when their term is come they shall neither delay it by a single hour nor can they hasten it
1662 they ascribe to allah what they themselves dislike their tongues utter falsehoods when they say the finest of wages shall be theirs without doubt the fire shall be theirs and they will be hastened to it
1663 indeed by allah we have sent messengers before you to other nations but satan made their deeds seem fair to them so that today he is their guardian and a painful punishment awaits them
1664 we have not revealed to you prophet muhammad the book except that you may clarify for them that upon which they differ and as guidance and mercy to a nation who believe
1665 allah sends down water from the sky with which he revives the earth after its death surely in this there is a sign for people who listen
1666 indeed in the cattle there is a lesson for you we give you to drink of that which is in their bellies between the filth bowels and blood pure milk which is sweet to those who drink
1667 and the fruits of the palm and of the vine from which you derive intoxicants and wholesome provisions surely in this there is a sign for nation who understand
1668 your lord revealed to the bee build your homes in the mountains in the trees and in what they are building
1669 eat every kind of fruit and follow the easy ways of your lord from its belly comes forth a drink honey of many hues in which there is healing for people surely in this there is a sign for a nation who reflect
1670 allah created you and causes you to die there are some of you who after knowing something will be kept back to the vilest state of life knowing nothing allah is the knowing powerful
1671 in your provisions allah has preferred some of you above others but those who have been preferred do not give their provisions to those whom their right hand possess so that they might be equal therein what do they vainly disbelieve the favor of allah
1672 allah has given you wives from among yourselves and has given you and your wives sons and grandsons and he has provided you with good things what do they believe in vanity do they disbelieve in the favor of allah
1673 do they worship other than allah that which has no power to provide them with anything either from the heavens or earth and can do nothing
1674 therefore do not strike parables for allah allah knows but you do not
1675 allah strikes a parable a servant owned by his master having no power over anything and one to whom we have given from us a fine provision who spends it secretly and openly are they equal praise be to allah no most of them do not know
1676 and allah strikes a parable two men one is dumb and powerless a burden to his master wherever he sends him he returns with no good is he equal with one who orders justice and follows the straight path
1677 to allah belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth the matter of the final hour shall be like the twinkling of an eye or even less allah has power over all things
1678 allah brought you out of your mothers wombs and gave you hearing sight and hearts in order that you be thankful
1679 have they not seen the birds that are subjected in the air of the heaven nothing holds them except allah surely in this are signs for those who believe
1680 and it is allah who has given you houses in which to rest and from the hides of cattle homes so they are light for you on the day you travel and on the day of settling while from their wool fur and hair he has given you furnishing and enjoyment for a while
1681 from the things he created allah has given you a covering shade and he has made for you refuges in the mountains he has given you garments to protect you from the heat and garments to protect you from your own violence as such it is that he perfects his favors upon you in order that you submit
1682 but if they turn away your mission is only to give plain warning
1683 they recognize the favors of allah then they disbelieve them most of them are unbelievers
1684 on the day we shall raise up from every nation a witness then permission will not be given to the unbelievers nor shall they be allowed to make restitution
1685 and when the harmdoers see their punishment it shall never be lightened nor shall they ever be respited
1686 and when the idolaters see their associates they will say our lord these are our associates on whom we called other than you but they will throw back at them saying surely you are truly liars
1687 on that day they shall offer to submit to allah and what they forged will forsake them
1688 those who disbelieve and bar others from the path of allah we shall add punishment upon their punishment because they were corrupting
1689 and on that day we shall raise up from every nation a witness from their own against them and we shall bring you prophet muhammad as a witness against those and we have sent down to you the book making everything clear as a guidance and mercy and glad tidings to those who submit
1690 allah orders justice and good deeds and giving to ones kindred he forbids indecency dishonor and insolence he admonishes you in order that you take heed
1691 fulfill the covenant of allah when you make a covenant and do not break your oaths after they have been confirmed by swearing in his name for you make allah your surety allah has knowledge of what you do
1692 do not be like the woman who breaks her thread after it is firmly spun into fibers by taking your oaths as mere mutual deceit one nation being more numerous than the other allah tries you with it on the day of resurrection he will clarify to you everything on which you were at variance
1693 had allah willed he would have made you one nation but he leads astray whomsoever he will and gives guidance to whomsoever he will you shall be questioned about what you did
1694 do not take oaths to deceive each other lest your foot should slip after its firmness lest you should taste evil for you barred others from the path of allah and lest a mighty punishment awaits you
1695 do not sell the covenant of allah for a trifling price what is with allah is better for you if you but knew
1696 that which you have is transitory but that which is with allah endures we shall reward the patient according to the best of their deeds
1697 for whosoever does a righteous deed be they believing men or women we shall recompense them with their wage according to the best of their deeds
1698 when you recite the koran seek refuge in allah from the stoned satan
1699 he has no authority over the believers who put their trust in their lord
16100 he has authority over those who are guided by him and those who ascribe associates to him allah
16101 when we exchange a verse for another and allah knows best what he is sending down they say you are but a forger no most of them do not know
16102 say the holy spirit gabriel brought it down from your lord in truth to confirm those who believe and to give guidance and glad tidings to those who surrender
16103 we know very well that they say a mortal teaches him the tongue of him at whom they hint is a nonarab and this is a clear arabic tongue
16104 those who disbelieve in the verses of allah allah does not guide them for them is a painful punishment
16105 none forge lies except those who disbelieve the verses of allah those they are the liars
16106 whosoever disbelieves in allah after believing except he who is forced while his heart remains in his belief but he who opens his chest for disbelief shall receive the anger of allah and for such awaits a mighty punishment
16107 that is because they loved this present life above the everlasting life allah does not guide the unbelievers
16108 they are those whose hearts hearing and sight are sealed by allah they are the heedless
16109 in the everlasting life they shall assuredly be the losers
16110 then indeed your lord to those who emigrated after they were persecuted and then strove and were patient surely your lord is thereafter forgiving the most merciful
16111 on the day when every soul will come pleading for itself and when every soul will be recompensed in full for what it did they shall not be wronged
16112 allah strikes a parable of the village which was safe and peaceful its provisions came in abundance from everywhere but it was thankless for the favors of allah therefore for what they were doing allah let it taste the garment of hunger and fear
16113 a messenger from their own was sent to them but they belied him so while they were harmdoers they were seized by the punishment
16114 eat of the lawful and good things with which allah has provided you and be thankful for the favors of allah if it is he you worship
16115 these things alone he has forbidden to you what is already dead blood the flesh of swine what has been offeredup to other than allah but to whoever is forced to eat any of these neither desiring nor wanting to transgress allah is forgiving merciful
16116 and do not say what your tongues falsely describe this is lawful and that is forbidden in order to forge a lie about allah indeed those who forge a lie about allah shall never prosper
16117 brief is their enjoyment after which a painful punishment awaits them
16118 we have forbidden the jews what we have already related to you we did not wrong them but they wronged themselves
16119 surely your lord to those who commit evil through ignorance and afterwards repent and mend their ways your lord thereafter is surely forgiving merciful
16120 abraham was equal to a nation obedient to allah of pure faith and was not among the idolaters
16121 ever thankful for his favors he chose him and he guided him to a straight path
16122 we gave goodness to him in this world and in the everlasting life he shall be amongst the righteous
16123 then we revealed to you follow the creed of abraham he of pure faith he was not among the idolaters
16124 the sabbath was ordained only for those who differed about it on the day of resurrection your lord will decide the differences that were between them
16125 call to the path of your lord with wisdom and fine admonition dispute with them in the best manner your lord is well aware of those who have gone astray from his path and he is well aware of those who are guided
16126 if you punish let your punishment be proportionate to the punishment you received but if you are patient it is better for the patient
16127 be patient yet your patience is only by the help of allah do not grieve for them the unbelievers nor distress yourself because of their devising
16128 allah is with the cautious and those who do good
171 exalted is he who carried his worshiper prophet muhammad to travel in the night from the sacred mosque to the furthest mosque which we have blessed around it so that we might show him some of our signs he is the hearer the seer
172 we gave moses the book and made it a guide for the children of israel take no guardian other than me
173 you are the descendants of those whom we carried in the ark with noah he was a truly thankful worshiper
174 and we decreed for the children of israel in the book you shall corrupt the land twice and you shall ascend exceedingly high
175 and when the promise of the first came we sent against you our worshipers those of great might and they went through the habitations and the promise was accomplished
176 then we gave the turn back to you to prevail over them and we helped you with wealth and children and made you the greater host
177 we said if you do good it shall be for your own souls but if you do evil it is likewise and when the second promise came we sent them against you to sadden your faces and to enter the mosque as they entered it the first time they utterly destroyed whatever they came across
178 perhaps allah will have mercy on you but if you return we will return we have made gehenna hell a prison for the unbelievers
179 this koran guides to the straightest way it gives glad tidings of a great wage to the believers who do good deeds
1710 and for those who do not believe in the everlasting life we have prepared for them a painful punishment
1711 yet the human prays for evil as he prays for good mankind is always hasty
1712 we appointed the night and the day as two signs then we blotted out the sign of the night and made the sign of the day to see so that you seek the bounty of your lord and that you know the number of years and the reckoning and we have clearly distinguished everything
1713 and to every human we have fastened to him his bird of deeds upon his neck and on the day of resurrection we shall bring forth to him a book spread open wide
1714 read your book your self suffices you this day as a reckoner against you
1715 whosoever is guided is only guided for his own self and whosoever goes astray it is only against it no soul shall bear anothers burden nor do we punish until we have sent a messenger
1716 when we desire to annihilate a village we command those who live in ease but they commit evil therein then the word is realized against it and it is utterly annihilated
1717 how many generations have we destroyed since noah your lord suffices as one who is aware of and sees the sins of his worshipers
1718 for whosoever desires this fleeting life we hasten for him whatever we will and to whom we want then we have prepared gehenna for him where he will be roasted condemned and rejected
1719 whosoever being a believer desires the everlasting life and strives for it as he should those their striving will be thanked
1720 we help these and those a gift from your lord and your lords gift is not restricted
1721 see how we have preferred some above others yet the everlasting life is greater in rank and greater in preferment
1722 do not set up with allah another god or you will sit condemned and forsaken
1723 your lord has ordered you to worship none except him and to be good to your parents if either or both of them attain old age with you do not say fieon you nor rebuke them but speak to them with words of respect
1724 and lower to them the wing of humbleness out of mercy and say my lord be merciful to them as they raised me since i was little
1725 your lord knows very well what is in your hearts if you are good he is forgiving to those who are penitent
1726 give to the near of kin the needy and the destitute traveler their rights and do not squander
1727 for the wasteful are the brothers of satan and satan is ungrateful to his lord
1728 but if you turn away from them to seek the mercy of your lord hoping to attain it then speak to them with gentle words
1729 and do not keep your hand chained to your neck when spending nor open it completely so that you will sit blamed and destitute
1730 your lord gives to whom he will his provisions both abundantly and sparingly he is aware and sees his worshipers
1731 do not kill your children because you fear poverty we will provide for you and them killing them is a great sin
1732 do not draw near to fornication for it is an indecency and its way is evil
1733 do not kill the soul whom allah has forbidden except by right if he is slain unjustly we have given his heir authority but let him not exceed the limit in slaying for he will be helped
1734 do not draw near the wealth of the orphan except in the best manner until he reaches maturity and keep your promise surely the promise will be questioned
1735 give full measure when you measure and weigh with even scales that is better and fairer in the end
1736 do not follow what you do not know the hearing sight and heart about all these you shall be questioned
1737 do not walk proudly in the earth indeed you will never tear open the earth nor attain the height of mountains
1738 the wickedness of all this is hateful with your lord
1739 that is of the wisdom your lord has revealed to you do not set up with allah another god or you will be cast into gehenna condemned and rejected
1740 what has your lord favored you with sons and taken to himself females from among the angels indeed you utter a monstrous thing
1741 in this koran we have clarified so that they may remember but it has only increased their aversion
1742 say if there had been other gods with him as they say they would surely have sought a way to the lord of the throne
1743 exaltations be to him high indeed be he exalted above what they say
1744 the seven heavens the earth and whosoever in them exalt him there is nothing that does not exalt with his praise but you do not understand their exaltation surely he is clement forgiving
1745 when you recite the koran we place between you and those who do not believe in the everlasting life an obstructing barrier
1746 we lay veils upon their hearts and heaviness in their ears lest they understand it when you prophet muhammad mention your lord alone in the koran they turn their backs in aversion
1747 when they listen to you we know very well how they listen when they conspire when the evildoers declare you are only following a man who is bewitched
1748 see what they compared you to they have surely gone astray and cannot find a path
1749 what they say when we are turned to bones and broken bits shall we be raised again in a new creation
1750 say let you be stones or iron
1751 or any other creation yet more monstrous in your minds they will ask who will restore us say he who originated you at first they will shake theirheads and ask when will this be say maybe it is near
1752 on that day he will summon you and you shall answer him with praise and you shall think you have stayed but for a little
1753 tell my worshipers that they should say words that are the finest satan would arouse discord among them he is the clear enemy of mankind
1754 your lord knows you very well he will have mercy on you if he will or punish you if he will we have not sent you to be their guardian
1755 your lord knows very well all who are in the heavens and the earth we have preferred some prophets above others and to david we gave the psalms
1756 say call to those whom you assert other than him they have neither the power to remove your affliction nor to transfer it
1757 those they call upon are themselves seeking a means to come to their lord competing with each other to be nearer they hope for his mercy and fear his punishment indeed the punishment of your lord is the subject of caution
1758 there is no village except that it shall be destroyed or that we will punish it with a stern punishment before the day of resurrection that is inscribed in thebook
1759 nothing prevented us from sending the signs but that the ancients belied them to thamood we brought the shecamel as a visible sign yet they wronged her we do not send signs except to frighten
1760 when we said to you indeed your lord encompasses all people we did not make the vision which we showed to you and the tree cursed in the koran except to be a trial for people and we frighten them but it only increases them in great insolence
1761 when we said to the angels prostrate yourselves before adam they all prostrated themselves except iblis father of the jinn who said shall i prostrate to him whom you have created from clay
1762 what do you think he said this whom you have honored above me if you defer me until the day of resurrection i will root out all but a few of his seed by misleading them
1763 begone said he indeed gehenna is your recompense and the reward of those who follow you an ample recompense
1764 rouse with your voice whoever you are able from among them rally against them your cavalry and those on foot share their wealth and children with them and promise them but satan promises them nothing except delusion
1765 over my worshipers you shall have no authority your lord is their sufficing guardian
1766 it is your lord who drives your ships at sea so that you may seek his bounty he is indeed the most merciful towards you
1767 when misfortune befalls you at sea all except he of those to whom you supplicate forsake you yet when he delivers you safely to the land you turn away the human is unthankful
1768 do you feel secure that he will not cause the shore to swallow you or let loose a squall of pebbles upon you then you shall find no guardian for yourself
1769 or do you feel secure that he will not send you back into it a second time and send against you a violent tempest and drown you because of disbelief then you shall find no prosecutor to help you against us
1770 we have honored the children of adam and carried them on both land and sea we have provided them with good things and greatly preferred them above much of our creation
1771 on the day when we call all the people with their record whosoever is given his book in his right hand shall read their book and they shall not be wronged by as much as a single datefiber
1772 but he who is blind in this life shall be blind in the everlasting life and will be further astray from the path
1773 indeed they were near to seducing you from that we revealed to you so that you might forge against us another and then they would surely have taken you as a friend
1774 and if we had not fortified you you would have been very slightly inclining towards them
1775 then we would have let you taste the double of life and death and you would have found none to help you against us
1776 they very nearly provoked you to drive you out of the land but they would have only lingered for a little while after you
1777 such was our way with those whom we sent before you you shall find no change in our way
1778 establish the prayer at the decline of the sun till the darkening of the night and the koran recital at dawn surely the koran recital at dawn is witnessed
1779 as for the night there is a voluntary deed for you to keep vigil in part it perhaps your lord will raise you to a praiseworthy station
1780 say lord grant me an entrance of sincerity and an exit of sincerity and give me from yours a victorious power
1781 say truth has come and falsehood has vanished indeed falsehood will certainly vanish
1782 we sent down of the koran that which is a healing and a mercy to believers but to the harmdoers it does not increase them except in loss
1783 yet when we bestow favors upon mankind he turns his back and withdraws to one side but when evil befalls him he despairs
1784 say each human works in his own manner but your lord knows very well who is best guided on the way
1785 they question you about the spirit say the spirit is from the command of my lord except for a little knowledge you have been given nothing
1786 if we pleased we could take away that which we have revealed to you then you should find none to guard you against us
1787 except for mercy from your lord for his favor to you is great indeed
1788 say if mankind and jinn combined together to produce the like of this koran they would never be able to produce one like it not even if they were to help one another
1789 indeed we have set forth for mankind in this koran every kind of parable yet most people refuse all except disbelief
1790 they say we will not believe in you until you make a spring gush from the earth for us
1791 or until you own a garden of palms and vines and cause rivers to gush forth with abundant water in them
1792 or until you cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces as you have claimed or as a surety bring allah with the angels in front
1793 or until you possess an ornate house of gold or ascend into the heavens and we will not believe in your ascension until you have brought down for us a book which we can read say exaltations to my lord am i anything except a human messenger
1794 nothing prevented people from believing when guidance came to them but the excuse has allah sent a human as a messenger
1795 say had there been angels walking at peace in the earth we would have sent down an angel from heaven to them as a messenger
1796 say allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you he knows and observes his worshipers
1797 those whom allah guides are rightly guided but for those whom he leads astray you shall find no guardian other than him on the day of resurrection we shall gather all of them upon their faces blind dumb deaf gehenna shall be their refuge whenever it dwindles we will increase the blaze for them
1798 that will be their recompense because they disbelieved our verses and said when we are turned to bones and broken bits shall we really be raised up once more as a new creation
1799 have they not seen that allah who has created the heavens and the earth has power to create their like there is no doubt that he has appointed for them aterm yet the unbelievers refuse all but disbelief
17100 say if you possessed the treasuries of my lords mercy you would hold them back for fear of spending and mankind is ever grudging
17101 to moses we gave nine clear signs ask the children of israel about how he came to them when pharaoh said to him moses i think you are bewitched
17102 you know he replied that none except the lord of the heavens and the earth has sent down these as clear proofs pharaoh i believe you are destroyed
17103 pharaoh sought to provoke them so that they would leave the land but we drowned him together with all who were with him
17104 and thereafter we said to the children of israel dwell in the land when the promise of the everlasting life comes we shall bring you all together
17105 we have sent it down with the truth and with the truth it has come down we have not sent you except a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
17106 and we have divided the koran for you to recite at intervals to mankind and we have sent it down successively
17107 say believe in it or do not believe when it is recited to those to whom knowledge was given before they fall prostrate upon their faces
17108 and say exaltations be to our lord the promise of our lord is done
17109 they fall down upon their chin weeping and it increases them in humility
17110 say call upon allah or call upon the merciful whichever name you call upon to him belong the most beautiful names pray neither loudly nor to quietly rather seek a middle course between them
17111 say praise be to allah who has not taken a son who has no associate in the kingdom nor out of humility any guardian and exalt him repeatedly with exaltations
181 praise belongs to allah who has sent down the book to his worshiper prophet muhammad and has not made any crookedness in it
182 unswerving to warn of great violence from him and to give good tidings to the believers who do good deeds that theirs shall be a goodly wage
183 and they will live for ever therein
184 and it the koran warns those who say allah has taken a son
185  surely of this they have no knowledge neither they nor their fathers it is a monstrous word that comes from their mouths they say nothing but a lie
186 yet perchance if they do not believe in this tiding you will consume yourself with grief and follow after them
187 we have appointed all that is on the earth an adornment for it in order that we try which of them is finest in works
188 we will surely reduce all that is on it to barren dust
189 or do you think the companions of the cave and the tomb stone were a wonder among our signs
1810 when the youths sought refuge in the cave they said lord give us from your mercy and furnish us with rectitude in our affair
1811 for many years we sealed up their hearing in the cave
1812 and thereafter we revived them to find out which of the two parties could best calculate the length of their stay
1813 in truth we tell to you their news they were young men who believed in their lord and we increased them in guidance
1814 we strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said our lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth we will call on no other god except him for if we did we would have spoken outrageously in disbelief
1815 these our nation have taken to themselves gods other than allah why do they not bring some clear authority regarding them who does greater evil than he who forges a lie against allah
1816 when you depart from them and from what they worship other than allah seek refuge in the cave allah will extend his mercy to you and will furnish you with a gentle issue of your affair
1817 you might have seen the rising sun incline towards the right of their cave and as it set go past them on the left while they stayed within an open space in the cave that was one of the signs of allah he whom allah guides is rightly guided but he whom he leads astray you shall not find for him a guardian to guide him
1818 you might have thought them awake though they were sleeping we turned them about to the right and to the left while their dog stretched its paws at the entrance had you seen them you would surely have become filled with terror and turned your back on them in flight
1819 as such we revived them so that they might question one another how long have you stayed here asked one of them we have been here a day or part of it they replied they said your lord knows best how long we have stayed here let one of you go to the city with this silver coin and let him search for one who has the purest food and bring provision from it let him be courteous but let no one sense it is you
1820 for if they appear in front of you they will stone you to death or restore you to their religion then you will never prosper
1821 and so we made them the unbelievers stumble upon them so that they might know that the promise of allah is true and that there is no doubt about thehour they argued among themselves over their affair then the unbelievers said build a building over them their remains their lord knows best who they were but those who prevailed over the matter said we will build around them a mosque
1822 some will say they were three their dog was the fourth others guessing at the unseen will say they were five and their dog was the sixth and yet others seven their dog was the eighth say my lord knows best their number except for a few none know their number therefore do not dispute with them except in outward disputation and do not ask any of them concerning them
1823 do not say of anything i will do it tomorrow
1824 unless you add if allah wills and remember your lord when you forget and say it may be that my lord will guide me to something nearer to rectitude than this
1825 and they stayed in the cave three hundred years and to that they added nine more
1826 say none but allah knows how long they stayed to him belong the unseen in the heavens and the earth how well he sees and how well he hears they have no other guardian other than him and he allows no one to share his rule
1827 recite what is revealed to you in the book of your lord no one can change his words you shall find no refuge other than him
1828 and be patient with those who call to their lord in the morning and evening desiring his face and do not turn your eyes away from them desiring the good things of this life nor obey he whose heart we have made neglectful of our remembrance so that he follows his own lust and his affair has become excessive
1829 say this is the truth from your lord let whosoever will believe and whosoever will disbelieve it for the harmdoers we have prepared a fire the pavilion of which encompasses them when they cry out for relief they shall be showered with water as hot as molten copper which will scald their faces how evil a drink and how evil a restingplace
1830 as for those who believe and do good works we do not waste the wage of whosoever does good works
1831 those they shall live in the gardens of eden underneath which rivers flow they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and arrayed in green garments of silk and brocade reclining therein on couches how excellent is their reward and how fine is their resting place
1832 give them the parable of two men to one we gave two gardens of vines and surrounded them with palm trees and in between the two we placed a sownfield
1833 each of the two gardens yielded its produce and did not fail in the least and we made a river to gush through them
1834 so he had fruit as he spoke with his companion as he was conversing with him my wealth is more abundant than yours and men have a greater respect for me
1835 and when having wronged himself he entered his garden he said i do not think that this will ever perish
1836 nor do i think that the hour will come even if i returned to my lord i should surely find a better place than this
1837 his companion said during his conversation with him what do you disbelieve in him who created you from dust then from a spermdrop and then fashioned you into a man
1838 he is allah my lord and i will not associate anyone with my lord
1839 when you entered your garden why did you not say if allah wills there is no power except by allah though you see me lesser than yourself in wealth and children
1840 maybe my lord will give me a garden better than yours and send down a thunderbolt from heaven so that in the morning it will be a slope of dust
1841 or in the morning its water will be drained into the earth so that you will not have a means to reach it
1842 and all his fruit were destroyed and in the morning he wrung his hands with grief at all he had spent on it for it had collapsed upon its trellises and he said would that i had not associated anyone with my lord
1843 he had no host to help him besides allah and he was helpless
1844 that day supremacy belongs only to allah the true he is the best to reward and the best ending
1845 give to them a parable about this present life it is like water we have sent down from the sky with which the plants of the earth mingle and in the morning it is straw the wind scatters allah is powerful over all things
1846 wealth and children are the ornament of this present life but the things that last and good deeds are better with your lord in reward and hope
1847 and on the day when we shall set the mountains in motion and you shall see the earth a leveled plain when we gather them together and would not leave even one behind
1848 and they shall be presented in ranks before your lord who will say to them you have returned to us as we created you the first time no you claimed we would not appoint a meeting for you
1849 and the book shall be set in place and you will see the sinners fearful of what is in it they shall say woe to us how is it this book omits nothing small or great all are counted and they shall find what they did is present and your lord will wrong no one
1850 when we said to the angels prostrate yourselves before adam all prostrated themselves except iblis who was one of the jinn disobedient to the command of his lord would you then take him and his descendants to be your guardians other than me when they are your clear enemy how evil is the exchange for the harmdoers
1851 neither did i make them witnesses at the creation of the heavens and the earth nor at their own creation i would never take those who lead others astray to be my supporters
1852 and the day he will say call on those whom you claimed to be my associates they will invoke them but they will receive no answer for we shall place a gulf between them
1853 and when the evildoers see the fire of hell they will reckon it is there they shall fall they shall find no escape from it
1854 we have set forth for people in this koran all manner of parables the human is the most disputatious of things
1855 nothing prevented people from believing and seeking the forgiveness of their lord when guidance came to them unless they are waiting for the fate of the ancients to overtake them or that the punishment should come upon them face to face
1856 we send our messengers only to proclaim glad tidings and to give warning but the unbelievers dispute with false arguments so that they may belie the truth they have taken my verses and warnings in mockery
1857 who is greater in evil than he who when reminded of the verses of his lord turns away from them and forgets what his hands have sent before him we have placed veils over their hearts lest they should understand it and there is heaviness in their ears even if you call them to guidance they will never be guided
1858 your lord is forgiving owner of mercy had it been his will to take them to task for what they earned he would have hastened their punishment but they have an appointed hour from which they will never escape
1859 and those villages when they became evil we destroyed them and appointed a meeting for their destruction
1860 when moses said to his assisting youth i will not give up until i reach the point where the two seas meet even though i should go on for many years
1861 but when they came to the point where the two met they forgot their fish which made its way burrowing into the sea
1862 and when they had gone further he said to his assisting youth bring us our breakfast we are worn out from our journey
1863 he replied what do you think i forgot the fish when we were resting on the rock none but satan made me forget to mention this it made its way into the sea in a marvelous fashion
1864 this is what we have been seeking said he and they retraced their footsteps
1865 and found one of our worshipers to whom we had given from our mercy and to whom we had taught knowledge of ours
1866 moses said to him may i follow you so that you can teach me of that you have learned of righteousness
1867 you will not bear patiently with me he replied
1868 for how can you bear patiently with that which you have never encompassed in your knowledge
1869 he moses said if allah wills you shall find me patient i shall not disobey your order
1870 he said if you follow me you must not question me about anything till i myself speak to you concerning it
1871 so they departed when they boarded a ship he bored a hole in it what have you made a hole in it he said is it to drown its passengers you have done a dreadful thing
1872 did i not i tell you he replied that you would not bear patiently with me
1873 moses said do not blame me for what i forgot nor press me to do something which is too difficult
1874 and so they departed thereafter they met a boy and he killed him he moses exclaimed what have you killed a pure soul and it was not done in retaliation for a soul you have done a terrible thing
1875 did i not tell you he replied that you would not be able to bear patiently with me
1876 he moses said if i question you again do not let me be your companion you already have enough excuse
1877 so they departed and thereafter they came to the inhabitants of a village they asked its inhabitants for some food but they declined to host them there they found a wall about to fall down whereupon his companion restored it he moses said had you wished you could have taken payment for that
1878 he said this is the parting between me and you but now i will tell you the interpretation of that which you could not patiently bear
1879 as for the ship it belonged to poor people working on the sea i rendered it imperfect because behind them there was a king who was taking every ship by brutal force
1880 as for the boy his parents are believers and we were afraid lest he should impose on them with his insolence and disbelief
1881 it was our wish that their lord should grant them another in exchange another better in purity and tenderness
1882 as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city beneath it was buried a treasure which belonged to them their father had been a righteous person and your lord willed that when they reach manhood to bring out their treasure as a mercy from your lord what i did was not done by my own command that is the interpretation of what you could not bear with patience
1883 they will ask you about thulkarnain the pious and chosen say i will recite to you something of his story
1884 we established him in the land and gave him means to all things
1885 he journeyed on a way
1886 until when he reached the setting of the sun he found it setting in a muddy spring and nearby he found a nation thulkarnain we said you must either punish them or show them kindness
1887 he replied the evildoer we shall punish then he shall return to his lord and he will punish him with a stern punishment
1888 as for he who believes and does good works he shall receive a fine reward in recompense and we shall speak to him with a mild command
1889 then he followed the road
1890 until he reached the rising of the sun he found it rising upon a nation for whom we provided no veil against it to shade them
1891 so we encompassed in knowledge what was with him
1892 then he followed the road
1893 when he reached between the two barriers he found on one side of them a nation who could barely understand speech
1894 thulkarnain they said look gog and magog are corrupting the earth build for us a barrier between us and them and we will pay you a tribute
1895 he replied that which my lord has given me is better therefore help me with all your power and i will build a barrier between you and between them
1896 bring me ingots of iron after he had leveled between the two cliffs he said blow and when he made it a fire he said bring me molten copper so that i may pour over it
1897 thereafter they could neither scale it nor could they pierce it
1898 he said this is a mercy from my lord but when my lords promise is come he will make it dust the promise of my lord is true
1899 on that day we will let them surge on one another and the horn shall be blown and we will gather them all together
18100 on that day we shall present gehenna hell to the unbelievers
18101 whose eyes were blinded to my remembrance and they were not able to hear
18102 do the unbelievers think that they can take my worshipers as guides other than me we have prepared gehenna to be the hospitality of the unbelievers
18103 say shall we tell you of those who are the greatest losers in deeds
18104 they are those whose striving in this world go astray while they think that what they are doing are good deeds
18105 those are they who disbelieve the verses of their lord and deny that they will ever meet him their deeds have failed on the day of resurrection we shall not give any weight to them
18106 gehenna is their recompense because they disbelieved and mocked my verses and my messengers
18107 the hospitality of those who believe and do good works shall be the gardens of paradise
18108 where they will live for ever and never wish that they should be removed from it
18109 say if the sea were ink for the words of my lord the sea would surely be spent before the words of my lord are spent even if we brought its like for replenishment
18110 say i am only a human like you revealed to me is that your god is one god let him who hopes for the encounter with his lord do good work and not associate anyone with the worship of his lord
191 kaafhayaaeensaad
192 a mention of the mercy of your lord to his worshiper zachariah
193 when he called upon his lord in secret
194 saying o my lord my bones are enfeebled and my head glows silver with age yet never lord have i been unblessed in prayer to you
195 indeed i fear my kinsmen who will succeed me for my wife is barren grant me a kinsman
196 who will be my heir and an heir to the house of jacob and make him my lord satisfied
197 o zachariah we give you good tidings of a son and he shall be called john yahya a name we have never given before
198 how shall i have a son lord he asked when my wife is barren and i am advanced in years
199 he replied it shall be so your lord says it is easy for me indeed i created you before time when you were not a thing
1910 he zachariah said lord make for me a sign he replied your sign is that you shall not speak to people for three nights being without fault
1911 then he came out from the sanctuary to his nation and gestured to them to exalt their lord at the dawn and at the evening
1912 we said o john hold fast to the book and we bestowed on him judgment while yet a child
1913 and tenderness from us and purity and he was cautious
1914 honoring his parents being neither arrogant nor rebellious
1915 peace be upon him on the day he was born and the day he dies and on him the day when he is raised up alive
1916 and mention in the book mary how she withdrew from her people to an eastern place and she took a veil apart from them
1917 we sent to her our spirit gabriel in the resemblance of a perfect human
1918 and when she saw him she said i take refuge in the merciful from you if you are fearful
1919 i am the messenger of your lord he replied and have come to give you a pure boy
1920 how shall i bear a son she answered when i am not touched by a human and not unchaste
1921 even so he replied as such your lord has said easy it is for me and we shall make him a sign to mankind and a mercy from us it is a matter decreed
1922 thereupon she carried him and retired to a far off place
1923 and when the birthpangs came upon her by the trunk of a palmtree she said oh would that i had died before this and become a thing forgotten
1924 he called from below to her do not sorrow look your lord has provided a rivulet below you
1925 and shake the trunk of this palmtree it will drop fresh ripe dates upon you
1926 therefore eat and drink and rejoice with your eyes if you meet any human say to him i have vowed a fast to the merciful and will not speak with anyone today
1927 she came to her nation carrying him and they said o mary you have committed a monstrous thing
1928 o sister of aaron your father was never an evil man nor was your mother unchaste
1929 so she pointed to him prophet jesus but they replied how can we speak with a baby in the cradle
1930 he the baby said i am the worshiper of allah allah has given me the book and made me a prophet
1931 he made me to be blessed wherever i am and he has charged me with prayer and charity for as long as i shall live
1932 he has made me kind to my mother he has not made me arrogant unprosperous
1933 peace be upon me on the day i was born and on the day i die and on the day when i shall be raised up alive
1934 such was prophet jesus the son of mary a saying of truth concerning what they doubt
1935 it is not for allah to take a son exaltations to him when he decrees a thing he only says be and it is
1936 indeed allah is my lord and your lord therefore worship him that is the straight path
1937 but the parties have fallen into variance among themselves then woe to those who disbelieve for the scene of a dreadful day
1938 how well they will hear and see on the day when they come before us the evildoers are today in clear error
1939 warn them of that day of anguish when the matter is determined whilst heedlessly they disbelieve
1940 for we shall inherit the earth and all that are on it to us they shall return
1941 mention in the book abraham he was truthful and a prophet
1942 he said to his father o father why worship that which can neither see nor hear nor helps you in anything
1943 father knowledge has come to me which has not come you therefore follow me i will guide you to a level path
1944 father do not worship satan for satan has rebelled against the merciful
1945 father i fear that the punishment of the merciful will fall upon you and you will become a guide of satan
1946 but he replied do you shrink away from my gods abraham surely if you do not cease i will stone you so leave me for awhile
1947 peace be on you he abraham said i shall call upon my lord to forgive you for to me he has been gracious
1948 now i will go away from you and that you call upon other than allah i will call on my lord perhaps i shall not be unblessed in calling my lord
1949 so when he turned away from them and those they worshipped other than allah we gave him isaac and jacob each of them we made a prophet
1950 and we gave them of our mercy and we appointed to them a truthful highly sincere tongue
1951 mention in the book moses he was devoted a messenger and a prophet
1952 we called out to him from the right side of the mountain and drew him near in divine conversation
1953 from our mercy we gave him his brother aaron a prophet
1954 and mention in the book ishmael he too was true to his promise a messenger and a prophet
1955 and he ordered his people to pray and to give charity and his lord was pleased with him
1956 and mention in the book idris he too was of the truth and a prophet
1957 we raised him to a high place
1958 these are whom allah has blessed among the prophets from among the seed of adam and of those whom we bore with noah the descendants ofabraham of israel and of those whom we have guided and chose for when the verses of the merciful were recited to them they fell down prostrate weeping
1959 but the generation that succeeded them wasted their prayers and followed their desires so they shall encounter error
1960 except he who repents and believes and does good works those shall be admitted to paradise and shall not be wronged in any way
1961 they shall enter the gardens of eden which the merciful has promised his worshipers in the unseen indeed his promise shall come
1962 there they shall hear no idle talk but only peace and there they shall be given their provision at dawn and at the evening
1963 that is the paradise which we shall give the cautious worshipers to inherit
1964 gabriel said we do not descend except at the command of your lord to him belongs all that is before us and all that is behind us and all that lies between your lord does not forget
1965 lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them so worship him be patient in his worship do you know any that can be named with his name
1966 the human says what when i am dead shall i be raised to life
1967 will the human not remember that we created him before when he was not a thing
1968 by your lord we will gather them and the satans and we shall parade them hobbling on their knees in gehenna
1969 from every party we will pluck out whichever of them was the most hardened in disdain of the most merciful
1970 we alone know who deserves most to be burned therein
1971 there is not one of you who shall not go down to it such is a thing decreed determined by your lord
1972 then we will save those who were cautious of us but the harmdoers shall be left there hobbling on their knees
1973 when our clear verses are recited to them the unbelievers say to the believers which of the two parties has a better position or company
1974 how many generations have we destroyed before them who were far greater in riches and more boastful
1975 say whosoever is in error let the most merciful prolong his life span until they see that which they were threatened be it a punishment or the hour thenshall they know whose is the worst place and who is weaker in hosts
1976 allah will increase those who were guided in guidance and things that abide good deeds are better in reward with your lord and better in return
1977 have you seen he who disbelieves our verses and yet says i shall surely be given wealth and children
1978 has he gained knowledge of the unseen or taken a covenant with the merciful
1979 on the contrary we will write down what he says and prolong the length of his punishment
1980 we shall inherit that of which he speaks and he will come before us alone
1981 and they have taken gods other than allah that they might be a power from them
1982 indeed no they will renounce their worship and turn against them
1983 have you not seen how we send down to the unbelievers satans who prick them
1984 therefore do not hasten things against them for we count out to them a number
1985 and on the day when we will ceremonially gather the righteous to the merciful
1986 and drive the evildoers as herds into gehenna
1987 who have no power of intercession except those who have taken a covenant with the merciful
1988 and they say the merciful has taken a son
1989 surely you have brought a monstrous thing
1990 thereby the heavens are nearly torn and the earth split asunder and mountains fall crashing down
1991 because they have ascribed a son to the merciful
1992 it is not for the merciful to take a son
1993 there is none in the heavens and earth except he comes to the merciful as a worshiper
1994 he has counted them and exactly numbered all
1995 and each one shall come to him on the day of resurrection alone
1996 those who believe and do righteous deeds the merciful will assign for them love
1997 we have made it easy in your own tongue in order that you proclaim the glad tidings to the cautious and give warning to a stubborn nation
1998 how many generations have we destroyed before them do you sense even one of them or hear a whisper from them
201 taha
202 we have not sent down the koran to you for you to be tired
203 but as a reminder to he who fears
204 it is a sending down from him who has created the earth and the high heavens
205 the merciful willed to the throne
206 to him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them and underneath the soil
207 if you speak loudly he has indeed knowledge of the secret and the hidden
208 allah there is no god except he to him belong the most beautiful names
209 has the story of moses reached you
2010 when he saw a fire he said to his family stay here for i can see a fire perhaps i can bring you a lighted torch or find at the fire guidance
2011 when he reached it he was called o moses
2012 i am your lord take off your shoes for you are in towa the sacred valley
2013 i have chosen you therefore listen to what shall be revealed
2014 indeed i am allah there is no god except me worship me and establish the prayer of my remembrance
2015 the hour is coming i almost conceal it so that every soul will be recompensed for its labors
2016 do not let those who disbelieve in it and follow their desires bar you from it or you will perish
2017 what is that in your right hand moses
2018 it is my staff moses replied upon it i lean and with it i beat down leaves to feed my sheep and for me there are other uses in it
2019 he said moses cast it down
2020 so he cast it down and thereupon it turned into a sliding serpent
2021 take it and do not fear he said we will restore it to its former state
2022 now put your hand under your armpit it shall come out white without evil a second sign
2023 but we shall show you some of our greatest signs
2024 24 go to pharaoh he has become insolent
2025 lord said moses expand my chest
2026 and ease my task for me
2027 unloose the knot upon my tongue
2028 that they may understand my speech
2029 appoint for me a minister from my family
2030 aaron my brother
2031 by him confirm my strength
2032 and let him share my task
2033 so that we exalt you
2034 and remember you abundantly
2035 you are surely seeing us
2036 he replied moses your request is granted
2037 we had already shown you favor
2038 when we revealed what was to be made known to your mother
2039 saying put him in the box and cast it into the river the river will cast him on to the bank and he shall be taken up by an enemy of mine and an enemy of his i lavished my love on you and to be formed in my sight
2040 your sister went to them and said shall i guide you to one who will nurse him and so we restored you to your mother so that her eyes might rejoice and that she might not sorrow and when you killed a soul we saved you from grief and then we tried you with many trials you stayed among the people of midian for a number of years and then moses you came here according to a decree
2041 i have chosen you for me
2042 go you and your brother with my signs and do not be negligent of my remembrance
2043 go to pharaoh for he has become insolent
2044 speak to him with gentle words perhaps he will ponder or fear
2045 o our lord both said we fear lest he may be excessive against us or become insolent
2046 he replied have no fear i shall be with you both hearing and seeing
2047 both of you go to him pharaoh and say we are the messengers of your lord let the children of israel depart with us and do not punish them we have come to you with a sign from your lord peace be on him who follows guidance
2048 it is revealed to us that a punishment will fall on those who belie and turn away
2049 he pharaoh said moses who is the lord of you both
2050 our lord he replied is he who gave everything its creation and then guided it
2051 he pharaoh asked how was it then with the former generations
2052 he moses answered the knowledge of them is in a book with my lord my lord neither goes astray nor forgets
2053 it is he who has made for you the earth as a cradle and threaded roads for you and sends down water from the sky with which we bring forth every kind of plant
2054 you eat and let your cattle graze surely in this there are signs for those of understanding
2055 we created you from it the earth and to it we shall restore you and from it we will bring you forth yet a second time
2056 so we showed him pharaoh our signs all of them but he belied and refused them
2057 he said moses have you come to drive us from our land with your sorcery
2058 we will indeed bring sorcery similar to yours appoint a meeting place between us and you in a place which is agreeable to both which neither we nor you shall not fail to keep
2059 he moses replied your meeting shall be on the day of the feast and let the people be assembled by midmorning
2060 so pharaoh withdrew and gathered his guile then returned
2061 and moses said to them alas do not forge a lie against allah lest he destroys you with a punishment indeed whosoever forges has failed
2062 they disputed upon their plan with one another and spoke in secret
2063 saying these two are sorcerers whose aim is to drive you from your land by their sorcery and destroy your noble ways
2064 gather your guile and then lineup a rank those who gain the upper hand today shall indeed prosper
2065 they said to moses will you throw down or shall we be the first
2066 moses replied no you throw first and by their sorcery it seemed to him that their ropes and staffs were sliding
2067 moses became fearful within himself
2068 but we said to him do not be afraid you shall surely be the uppermost
2069 throw that which is in your right hand it will swallow up that which they have made for that which they made is but the guile of a sorcerer wherever he goes the sorcerer does not prosper
2070 thereafter the sorcerers threw themselves down prostrating saying we believe in the lord of aaron and moses
2071 have you believed him before i have given you permission he pharaoh said indeed he must be your chief the one who taught you sorcery i will cut off on opposite sides a hand and a foot then crucify you on the trunks of palmtrees indeed you shall know whose punishment is more stern and more lasting
2072 their reply was we will not prefer you over the clear signs that have come to us nor over him who has created us so decide upon whatever you decide you can only decided upon things in this present life
2073 we believe in our lord so that he forgives us our sins and the sorcery you have forced us to practice allah is better and everlasting
2074 gehenna hell awaits whosoever comes before his lord as a sinner there he shall neither die nor live
2075 but for whosoever comes before him as a believer and having done good works there awaits the most highest degree
2076 living for ever in the gardens of eden underneath which rivers flow such shall be the recompense of he who purifies himself
2077 to moses we also revealed set forth with my worshipers by night and strike for them a dry path in the sea do not fear that you will be overtaken neither be afraid
2078 pharaoh pursued them with his legions so they were overwhelmed from the sea with that which drowned them
2079 for pharaoh had misled his nation and did not guide them
2080 children of israel we saved you from your enemies and made a covenant with you on the right side of the mountain we sent down manna and quails
2081 eat of the good things with which we have provided you and do not transgress therein lest my anger should fall upon you and upon whosoever my anger falls has assuredly fallen
2082 but to whosoever repents believes and does good deeds and is at last guided i am forgiving
2083 moses why have you come with such haste from your nation
2084 moses replied they are following me my lord i made haste only so that i might please you
2085 he allah said we tempted your nation in your absence and the samaritan has misled them into error
2086 with great anger and sorrow moses returned to his nation my nation he said did your lord not make you a fine promise did the time of the covenant seem long to you or did you desire that the anger of your lord should fall upon you so that you failed in your coming to my appointment
2087 they replied we have not failed in our promise to you through our choosing we were laden with fardels even the ornaments of the nation and threw them just as the samaritan had thrown them into the fire
2088 and made a calf for them a figure that lowed this they said is your god and the god of moses but whom he has forgotten
2089 what did they not see that it did not speak a word to them in return and for them it could own neither harm nor benefit
2090 aaron had said to them before my nation you have been tempted by it your lord is the merciful follow me and obey my order
2091 they replied we will not stop we will cling to it until moses returns to us
2092 he moses said to aaron when you saw them in error what prevented you
2093 from following after me did you disobey my order
2094 son of my mother he replied do not seize my beard nor my head i was afraid that you might say you have divided the children of israel and did not uphold my word
2095 you samaritan said he moses what was your business
2096 he replied i saw what they did not see and seized a handful of dust from the foot print of the messenger and so i cast it this my soul prompted me to do
2097 begone your lot in this life is to cry untouchable said he moses an appointment awaits you that you cannot fail to keep look at your god which you clung to indeed we will burn it and scatter its ashes upon the sea
2098 your god is only one allah there is no god except he alone his knowledge encompasses all things
2099 and so we narrate to you the stories of the past and we have given you a remembrance from us
20100 whosoever has turned away from it shall bear a burden on the day of resurrection
20101 and live in it for ever how evil will that burden be for them on the day of resurrection
20102 the day when the horn shall be blown on that day we shall assemble all the sinners with blued eyes
20103 and they shall murmur among themselves you have stayed away but ten days and nights
20104 we know well what they will say the most just among them in the matter will declare you have stayed away but one day
20105 they will question you about the mountains say my lord will scatter them as ashes
20106 and leave them a desolate waste
20107 with neither crookedness nor any curving to be seen therein
20108 on that day they will follow the summoner who is not crooked their voices hushed before the merciful and you shall hear nothing except a murmuring
20109 on that day intercession will not benefit them except him that has received the permission of the merciful and whose words are pleased by him
20110 he knows what is before them and behind them and they do not comprehend him in knowledge
20111 all faces shall be humbled before the living one the eternal those who are burdened with wrong doing shall have failed
20112 but those who have believed and done good works shall fear neither wrong nor injustice
20113 as such we sent it down an arabic koran and explained in it threats in order that they be cautious or that it prompts the remembrance in them
20114 highly exalted be allah the true king do not hasten with the koran before its revelation has been completed to you but say lord increase me in knowledge
20115 we made a covenant with adam but he forgot and we found in him no constancy
20116 and when we said to the angels prostrate yourselves before adam they all prostrated themselves except iblis who refused
20117 adam we said this is you and your wifes enemy do not let him expel you from the garden so that you adam will be tired
20118 it has been given to you so that you shall neither become hungry nor naked therein
20119 there you shall neither thirst nor suffer from the sun
20120 but satan whispered to him saying adam shall i direct you the tree of eternity and a kingdom which never decays
20121 they both ate of it and their shameful parts appeared to them whereupon they began to stitch upon themselves leaves from the garden and so it was adam erred and disobeyed his lord
20122 but afterwards his lord chose him he turned again towards him and guided him
20123 both of you together go down out of it the garden each of you an enemy to the other he said but if my guidance comes to you whosoever followsmy guidance shall neither go astray nor be unprosperous
20124 but whosoever turns away from my remembrance his life shall be narrow and on the day of resurrection we shall raise him blind
20125 my lord he will say why have you raised me blind when i was able to see
20126 he allah will say it is so our verses came to you and you forgot them so this day you are forgotten
20127 in this way we recompense the prodigal who disbelieves the verses of his lord but the punishment of the everlasting life is more terrible and everlasting
20128 is it not a guidance to them how many generations we destroyed before them in whose dwelling places they walk surely in this there are signs for thoseof reason
20129 except for a word that preceded from your lord and a stated term it had been fastened
20130 therefore be patient with what they say and exalt with the praise of your lord before sunrise and before sunset and in the watches of the night and at the edges of the day exalt him so that you will be pleasing
20131 do not stretch your eyes at the flower of this life which we have given couples to enjoy it is with this that we might try them and the provision of yourlord is better and more enduring
20132 order your family to pray and be patient in it we do not ask you for provisions rather it is we who provide for you and the final outcome is for the cautious
20133 they say why does he not bring us a sign from his lord did not a clear sign come to them in the preceding scrolls
20134 had we destroyed them with a punishment before this they would have said our lord why did you not send us a messenger so that we could have followed your verses before we were humiliated and degraded
20135 say everyone is waiting so wait indeed you shall know who are the companions of the even path and those who are guided
211 the reckoning for mankind is drawing near yet they are heedless and turn away
212 no recent revival of the remembrance comes to them from their lord except that they play with it as they listen
213 their hearts are diverted the harmdoers mutter to one another is this anything else but a human like yourself what will you follow sorcery with your eyes open
214 he said my lord has knowledge of what is said in the heavens and on earth he is the hearer the knower
215 some say no it is only mixed dreams no he has forged it himself or no he is a poet let him bring us a sign just as the ancient ones were sent asmessengers
216 of the villages we destroyed there was not one that believed what will they not believe
217 we never sent anyone before you except men to whom we revealed to them ask the people of the remembrance if you do not know
218 nor did we make them bodies that ate no food nor were they immortal
219 then we were true to the promise we saved them together with those whom we willed and destroyed the transgressors
2110 now we have sent down to you a book in which is your remembrance will you not understand
2111 how many harmdoing villages have we shattered and replaced them with another nation
2112 and when they felt our might they fled from it
2113 do not run away return to your luxury that you rejoiced in and your homes in order that you be questioned
2114 they said alas for us we were harmdoers
2115 and this they did not stop crying out until we made them stubble silent and still
2116 it was not in play that we created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them
2117 had we wished to take to us an amusement we would have taken it to us from ours had we done so
2118 no we hurl truth at falsehood and it shall conquer it and see falsehood vanishes woe to you for all you have described
2119 to him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and the earth those who are with him are not too proud to worship him nor are they ever wearied
2120 they never fail to exalt him either at night or in the day
2121 or have they taken earthly gods who revive the dead
2122 had there been gods in heaven or earth other than allah both would indeed have been ruined exalted be allah lord of the throne above that they describe
2123 he is not to be questioned about what he does but they shall be questioned
2124 have they taken gods other than him say bring us your proof here is the remembrance of he who is with me and the remembrance of those before me but no most of them do not know the truth therefore they turn away
2125 we never sent a messenger before you except that we revealed to him saying there is no god except me therefore worship me
2126 they say the merciful has taken a son exaltations to him no they are only his honored worshipers
2127 who do not surpass him in speech and do as he commands
2128 he knows what is before them and what is behind them they intercede for none except for him whom he is well pleased and they tremble in awe of him
2129 if any one of them says i am a god other than him we will recompense him with gehenna hell as such we recompense the harmdoers
2130 have the unbelievers not seen that the heavens and the earth were sewn up as one solid mass then we unstitched them and that we made every living thing of water will they not believe
2131 we set firm mountains upon the earth lest it should shake with them and we placed therein ravines to be paths so that they might be guided
2132 we established the heaven as a well protected roof yet they still turn away from its signs
2133 it is he who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon each floating in an orbit
2134 we have never assigned immortality to a human before you therefore if you yourself die will they live for ever
2135 every soul shall taste death we will try you with a trial of evil and good then to us you shall be returned
2136 when the unbelievers see you they take you only for mockery saying is this he who talks about your gods while they are unbelievers in the remembrance of the merciful
2137 the human was created of haste indeed i will show you my signs so do not ask me to hasten them
2138 they say if you are truthful when will this promise come
2139 if the unbelievers only knew when they will be unable to shield either their faces or their backs from the fire when they will not be helped
2140 it will overtake them suddenly dumbfounding them they shall be unable to ward it off and they shall not be respited
2141 before you other messengers were mocked but the mockers were encompassed by the very thing they mocked
2142 say who will guard you by night and by day from the merciful but no they turn away from their lords remembrance
2143 or have they gods to defend them other than us indeed they are unable to help themselves neither shall they be guarded in safety from us
2144 we gave days of enjoyment to them and their fathers until their life became long are they unable to see how we come to their land and reduce its borders or is it they who are the victors
2145 say i warn you only by the revelation but the deaf hear nothing when they are warned
2146 but if just a breath of your lords punishment were to touch them they would say woe for us we were harmdoers
2147 on the day of resurrection we shall set up just scales so that no soul shall in the least be wronged even though it be the weight of a grain of mustard seedwe will bring it we suffice as reckoners
2148 we gave moses and aaron the criterion and gave them a light and a remembrance for the cautious
2149 those who fear allah in the unseen tremble because of the hour
2150 this is a blessed remembrance which we have sent down do you disbelieve it
2151 before this we gave abraham his virtue for we knew him
2152 he said to his father and to his nation what are these the statues to which you cling
2153 they replied we found our fathers worshipping them
2154 he said truly you and your fathers are in clear error
2155 they said is it the truth you have brought us or are you one of those that play
2156 no he answered your lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth the originator of them and i am among those bearing witness to it
2157 by allah i will certainly outwit your idols as soon as you have turned your backs and gone
2158 he broke them all into pieces except their great one so that they might return to it
2159 who has done this to our gods they exclaimed he must surely be a harmdoer
2160 we have heard a young man called abraham mention them they replied
2161 they said then bring him here so that the people may see so that they may bear witness
2162 abraham they said was it you who did this to our gods
2163 no he replied it was their great one amongst them that did it ask them if they are able to speak
2164 so they returned one to another saying surely it is you who are the harmdoers
2165 but then they reversed their minds you know they do not speak
2166 he said would you then worship that instead of allah which can neither help nor harm you
2167 shame on you and on that you worship other than allah have you no understanding
2168 they said burn him and help your gods if you are going to do anything
2169 o fire we said be coolness and safety for abraham
2170 they sought to outwit him but we made them the worst of losers
2171 we saved him and lot and brought them to the land which we had blessed for all the worlds
2172 we gave him in excess isaac and jacob for a grandson and we made each righteous
2173 and appointed them leaders to guide by our command and we revealed to them to do good deeds and to establish the prayer and the giving of charity and they were for us worshipers
2174 to lot we gave judgment and knowledge and saved him from the village that had been committing corrupt deeds for they were an evil nation and were debauched
2175 we admitted him to our mercy he was among the righteous
2176 and remember noah when he supplicated to us we answered him and we saved him and his nation from great distress
2177 and helped him against the nation who had belied our signs they were an evil nation we drowned them all
2178 and david and solomon they passed judgment upon the tilled land on which the people s sheep had strayed we bore witness to their judgment and
2179 we made solomon to understand it and to both we gave judgment and knowledge and with david we subjected the mountains and birds to exalt allah all this we have done
2180 we taught him the craft of making garments that fortify you against your own violence are you thankful
2181 to solomon the raging wind ran at his command to the land which we had blessed we have knowledge of all things
2182 and some of the satans dived for him and others did work as well we were watching over them
2183 and job when he called to his lord affliction has befallen me and you are the most merciful of the merciful
2184 we answered him and removed his affliction and we gave his people and those like them that were with them mercy from us as a reminder to those who worship
2185 and ishmael idris and thulkifl the son of job each were patient
2186 we admitted them to our mercy for they were of the righteous
2187 and thulnun prophet jonah he went away in anger thinking we had no power over him but in the darkness he cried there is no god except you exaltations to you i was among the harmdoers
2188 we heard his prayer and saved him from grief as such we shall save the believers
2189 and zachariah when he called to his lord saying lord do not let me remain by myself you are the best of inheritors
2190 so we answered him and gave him john curing his wife of sterility they raced with each other in good works and called on us out of yearning and awe and they were humble to us
2191 and she mary who guarded her virginity we breathed into her of our spirit gabriel and made her and her son a sign for the worlds
2192 indeed this nation of yours is one nation and i am your lord therefore worship me
2193 but they the christians and jews split their affair between them all shall return to us
2194 the endeavors of he who believes and does good works shall not go unthanked we write it down for him
2195 it is ordained that no village we have destroyed shall return
2196 till gog and magog are let loose and slide down out of every slope
2197 when the true promise draws near the eyes of the unbelievers will stare and they will say alas for us of this we have been heedless we have beenharmdoers
2198 you and all those who you were worshipping other than allah shall be the fuel of gehenna there you shall all go down to it
2199 if those had been gods they would never have gone down to it but in it they shall live for ever
21100 there is groaning for them therein and they do not hear
21101 but those whom we have surpassed with the finest rank from us shall be far removed from it
21102 neither shall they hear any of its whisper but shall live for ever in that their souls desired
21103 the greatest terror shall not grieve them and the angels will receive them this is the day you have been promised
21104 on that day we shall roll up the heaven like a written scroll is rolled as we originated the first creation so will we bring it back again this is a binding promise on us which we shall assuredly fulfill
21105 we have written in the psalms after the remembrance the righteous among my worshipers shall inherit the earth
21106 surely in this is a proclamation to a worshiping nation
21107 we have not sent you prophet muhammad except as a mercy to all the worlds
21108 say it is revealed to me that your god is one god do you then surrender
21109 if they turn back say i have warned you all alike though i cannot tell whether what you are promised is imminent or distant
21110 he knows your spoken words and what you hide
21111 and i do not know if this is a trial for you and an enjoyment for a time
21112 he said my lord judge in truth our lord is the merciful whose help is ever to be sought against what you describe
221 o people have fear of your lord the earthquake of the hour shall be a great thing
222 on that day you will see every one that suckles shall forsake her suckling and every carrier shall miscarry and you shall see mankind drunk although they arenot drunk dreadful will be the punishment of allah
223 among people there are those who without knowledge dispute about allah and follow every rebel satan
224 against whom it is written down that whosoever takes him for a guide he guides astray and leads him to the punishment of the blaze
225 o people if you are in doubt about the resurrection remember that we first created you from dust then from a sperm drop then from a clot and then from a bitesize tissue formed and unformed so that we might clarify for you we establish in the wombs whatever we will for an appointed term and then we bring you forth as infants then you come of age some of you die and some of you are kept back to the vilest state of life after knowing somewhat they know nothing and you see the earth dry but no sooner do we send down rain upon it than it begins to quiver and swell putting forth every fine variety of herbage
226 that is because allah is the truth he revives the dead and has power over all things
227 and the hour is sure to come there is no doubt and allah will raise up those in the graves
228 some dispute about allah though they have neither knowledge nor guidance nor an illuminating book
229 there is for him who turns his side to lead others astray from the path of allah degradation in this life and we shall let him taste the punishment of theburning on the day of resurrection
2210 this is the reward for what your hands have forwarded allah is not unjust to the worshipers
2211 there are among the people such who worship allah and yet stand on the very edge when goodness comes to him he is content but if a trial befalls him he falls upon his face he loses this world and the everlasting life that is indeed a clear loss
2212 he calls to other than allah to that which neither hurts him nor benefits him that is indeed far error
2213 he calls upon him whose harm is nearer than his benefit an evil guide and an evil friend
2214 as for those who believe and do good works allah will admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow allah indeed does what he will
2215 if any one thinks that allah will not give him prophet muhammad victory in this present world and in the everlasting life let him stretch a rope to heaven and let him sever it then let him see if his guile does away with that which has enraged him
2216 as such we have sent it in clear verses indeed allah gives guidance to whom he will
2217 surely they that believe and those of jewry the sabaeans the nazarenes the magians and the unbelievers allah will judge them on the day of resurrection surely allah is witness over everything
2218 have you not seen that to allah prostrate all who are in the heavens and all who are in the earth the sun and the moon the stars and the mountains the trees and the beasts and many people and many deserve the punishment he who is abased by allah has none to honor him allah does what he will
2219 those are two who disputed concerning their lord garments of fire have been prepared for the unbelievers boiling water shall be poured over their heads
2220 and that which is in their bellies and their skins shall be melted
2221 for them are hooked rods of iron
2222 whenever in their anguish they try to get out of it they are restored to it it will be said taste the punishment of burning
2223 allah will admit those who believe and do good works to gardens underneath which rivers flow they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and with pearls and their garments shall be of silk
2224 for they shall be guided to good speech and guided to the praised path
2225 the unbelievers who bar from the way of allah and from the holy mosque which we made equal for all peoples he who cleaves to it and the tentdweller alike and whosoever seeks to violate it wrongfully we shall let him taste a painful punishment
2226 and when we settled for abraham and ishmael the place of the holy mosque we said you shall not associate with me anything purify my house for those who circumambulate it and those who stand for those who bow and prostrate
2227 proclaim the pilgrimage to the people they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel they shall come from every deep ravine
2228 that they witness profitable things for them and mention the name of allah on well known days over the flocks which he has provided them eat thereof and feed the wretched poor
2229 then let the pilgrims accomplish their acts of cleansing and let them fulfill their vows and circumambulate the ancient house
2230 all that and whosoever venerates the sacred rites of allah it shall be better for him with his lord the flocks are lawful to you except that which is recited to you therefore avoid the filth of idols and avoid speaking falsely
2231 being of pure faith to allah not associating anything with him he who associates others with allah is like he who falls from heaven and is snatched away by the birds or carried by the wind to some faroff place
2232 all that and he who venerates the waymarks of allah surely it is from the piety of the hearts
2233 in them you have benefits until an appointed time after their place of sacrifice is at the ancient house
2234 for every nation we have appointed a holy ritual that they pronounce the name of allah over the beast of flocks which he has provided them your god isone god to him surrender yourselves give glad tidings to the humble
2235 whose hearts when allah is mentioned quake who endure their misfortunes with patience and establish their prayers and spend of that which we have provided them
2236 and the camels we have made a part of the waymarks of allah in them is good for you pronounce over them the name of allah when they are hobbled and when they have fallen down on their sides eat of them and feed the impoverished nonrequestor and the requestor as such we have subjected them to you in order that you give thanks
2237 their flesh and blood does not reach allah rather it is piety from you that reaches him as such he has subjected them to you in order that you exalt allahfor guiding you and give glad tidings to the generous
2238 allah will defend those who believe verily allah does not love the ungrateful cheat
2239 permission is given to those who fight because they were wronged allah has power to grant them victory
2240 those who have been unjustly driven from their homes just because they said our lord is allah had allah not repelled some people by the means ofothers the monasteries and churches the synagogues and mosques in which the name of allah is remembered would have been destroyed but whoever helps allah shall be helped by him allah is the strong the almighty
2241 those who if we established them in the land will establish the prayers and pay the obligatory charity order with honor and forbid dishonor and to allah is the end of all affairs
2242 if they belie you so too before them the nation of noah belied and aad and thamood
2243 and the nation of abraham and the nation of lot
2244 and the inhabitants of midian to moses they also belied i respited the unbelievers then i seized them and how was my disapproval
2245 how many a village we have destroyed in its harmdoing so that it lies fallen upon its turrets and how many an abandoned well and empty palace
2246 have they never journeyed through the land so that they have hearts to understand or ears to hear with it is not the eyes but the hearts in the chests that are blind
2247 they ask you to hasten the punishment allah will not break his promise each day with your lord is like a thousand years in your reckoning
2248 and how many a village have i respited in its evil doing then i seized it to me is the return
2249 say prophet muhammad o people i have been sent to warn you plainly
2250 those who believe and do good works theirs shall be forgiveness and a generous provision
2251 but those who strive to void our verses thinking they have escaped shall be the people of hell
2252 never have we sent a messenger or a prophet before you but when he hoped satan tampered with his hope but allah supersedes the tampering of satan and confirms his verses and allah is the knower the wise
2253 this he permits in order that he makes satans interjections a temptation for those in whose hearts is a sickness and those whose hearts are hardened and the harmdoers are in a wide schism
2254 and so that those to whom knowledge has been given will know that this is the truth from your lord and so believe in it and that their hearts will be humble to him indeed allah will surely guide those who believe to a straight path
2255 the unbelievers will never cease to doubt it until the hour overtakes them suddenly or the punishment of the barren day comes upon them
2256 the kingdom upon that day shall belong to allah he will judge between them those who believe and do good works shall be in gardens of bliss
2257 but for those who disbelieved our verses and belied there awaits a humbling punishment
2258 as for those who emigrated in the way of allah and were slain or died allah will provide them with fine provisions allah is the best of providers
2259 he will admit them by a gate that is pleasing to them and surely allah is the knower the clement
2260 so shall it be he who punishes after the manner that he was punished and then again is oppressed shall be helped by allah allah is pardoning forgiving
2261 that is because allah causes the night to enter into the day and the day enter into the night allah is the hearer and the seer
2262 that is because allah is the truth and falsehood is all that they call upon other than him allah is the most high the most great
2263 do you not see that allah sends down water from the sky and in the morning the earth becomes green allah is subtle the aware
2264 to him belong all that is in the heavens and earth surely allah is the rich the praised
2265 do you not see that allah has subjected to you all that is on the earth and the ships which run upon the sea by his command he holds the sky back lest it should fall upon the earth except by his permission allah is gentle to people the most merciful
2266 it is he who revives you then he will cause you to die and then he revives you indeed the human is ungrateful
2267 for every nation we have appointed a holy rite which they shall perform do not let them dispute with you concerning the matter call to your lord surely you are upon a straight path
2268 if they argue with you say allah knows best all that you do
2269 on the day of resurrection allah will judge between you concerning that in which you vary
2270 are you not aware that allah has knowledge of what is in the heaven and earth this is recorded in a book that is easy for allah
2271 yet they worship that for which he did not send down authority and that of which they have no knowledge indeed the harmdoers shall have no helpers
2272 when our clear verses are recited to them you will recognize denial upon the faces of the unbelievers they nearly rush upon those who recite our verses to them say shall i tell you what is worse than that the fire which allah has promised those who disbelieve an evil arrival
2273 people this is a parable listen to it those whom you call upon other than allah could never create a fly though they banded together to do this and if a fly robs them of anything they could never rescue it from it the seeker and the sought are alike in their weakness
2274 they do not value allah as he should be valued for allah is powerful and mighty
2275 allah chooses messengers from angels and from people allah is the hearer the seer
2276 he knows what is before them and behind them to allah all things are returned
2277 o you who believe bow down and prostrate yourselves worship your lord and do good in order that you prosper
2278 struggle for allah as is due to him he has chosen you and has not laden a burden upon you in your religion being the creed of abraham your father he has named you muslims before and in this so that the messenger muhammad can be a witness for you and in order that you be witnesses against mankind therefore establish the prayer and pay the obligatory charity and hold fast to allah he is your guardian the excellent guardian the excellent helper
231 prosperous are the believers
232 who are humble in their prayers
233 who turn away from idle talk
234 who give charity
235 who guard their privates
236 except with their wives and what their right hand possess and then they are not blamed
237 those who seek beyond that are transgressors
238 prosperous are those who preserve their trusts and pledges
239 and those who observe their prayers
2310 those are the heirs
2311 who will inherit paradise they shall live there for ever
2312 we created the human from an essence of clay
2313 then we made him a drop in a secure receptacle the womb
2314 then we created of the drop a clot of congealed blood and we created the clot into bitesize tissue then we created the bitesize tissue into bones thenwe clothed the bones with flesh and then produced it an other creation blessed is allah the best of creators
2315 after that you shall surely die
2316 and be resurrected on the day of resurrection
2317 we have created seven ways above you of our creation we are never inattentive
2318 we sent down water from the sky in due measure and lodged it in the earth and we are able to take it all away
2319 with it we produced for you gardens of palms and vines yielding abundant fruit for you to eat
2320 also a tree which grows on the tor of sinai and gives oil and relish for its eaters
2321 in the cattle too is a lesson for you we let you drink of that which is in their bellies and there are many benefits in them for you and you eat of them
2322 and upon them and on the ships you are carried
2323 we sent noah to his nation worship allah my nation he said for you have no god except he will you not be cautious
2324 the unbelieving assembly of his nation said this is but a human like you who desires to gain superiority over you had allah willed he could have sent down angels we never heard of this among our ancient forefathers
2325 he is nothing else except a man who is mad so watch him for awhile
2326 he noah said lord help me for they belie me
2327 we said to him make the ark under our eye and our revelation and then when our command comes and the oven gushes water take onboard a pair from every kind and your family except him against whom the decision has already been passed do not address me concerning those who have done evil they shall be drowned
2328 and when you and all those with you are seated in the ark say praise be to allah who has saved us from the harmdoing nation
2329 and say lord let me land a blessed landing you are the best of harborers
2330 surely in that are signs and surely we will put nations to the test
2331 then we produced after them another generation
2332 and we sent to them a messenger from themselves saying worship allah for you have no god except he will you not be cautious
2333 the unbelieving assembly of his nation who belied the encounter of the everlasting life and on whom we had bestowed ease in this life said this is but a human like yourselves he eats of what you eat and drinks of what you drink
2334 if you obey a mortal like yourselves you shall be lost
2335 what does he promise you that when you are dead and turned to dust and bones you will be brought forth
2336 after after with that which you are promised
2337 there is nothing but our present life we die and we live and we shall not be resurrected
2338 he is nothing but a man who has forged against allah a lie we will never believe him
2339 he said help me lord they belie me
2340 he replied before long by the morning they shall be remorseful
2341 and the cry seized them in justice and we made them withered so begone with the harmdoing nation
2342 after them we produced other generations
2343 no nation outstrips its term nor do they put it back
2344 then we sent our messengers in succession yet whenever its messenger came to a nation they belied him so we made them follow others and we made them but as tales so begone the nation who did not believe
2345 then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our signs and clear authority
2346 to pharaoh and his council but they were very proud and they were a tyrannical nation
2347 what they said are we to believe in two mortals like us whose nation are our worshipers
2348 so they belied them and they were among the destroyed
2349 and we gave moses the book in order that they might be guided
2350 we made the son of mary and his mother a sign and gave them a refuge on a hillside where there was a hollow and a spring
2351 messengers eat of that which is good and do good deeds i have knowledge of the things you do
2352 your nation is but one nation and i am your lord therefore fear me
2353 yet they have split their affairs between themselves into sects each rejoicing in what it has
2354 leave them in their perplexity for a time
2355 do they think that in giving them wealth and children
2356 we hasten in good works for them no they are not aware
2357 those who tremble in fear of their lord
2358 who believe in the verses of their lord
2359 who associate none with their lord
2360 who give what they give with their hearts quaking that they will return to their lord
2361 those hasten in good works outracing to them
2362 we charge no soul with more than it can bear we have a book with us which speaks the truth and they shall not be wronged
2363 but their hearts are in ignorance of this koran and they have deeds besides that which they are doing
2364 but when we seize with the punishment those of them that live in ease they groan
2365 we shall say do not groan today surely you shall receive no help from us
2366 my verses were recited to you but you turned upon your heels
2367 being proud against it talking foolishness by night
2368 should they not think upon the saying or did anything come upon them that had not come upon their ancient forefathers
2369 or is it because they do not recognize their messenger that they denied him
2370 do they say he is mad no he came to them with the truth but most of them hate the truth
2371 had the truth followed their fancies the heavens the earth and all who live in them would have surely been corrupted no we brought them theirremembrance but from their remembrance they turn away
2372 or do you ask a tribute from them your lords tribute is better he is the best of providers
2373 indeed you are calling them to a straight path
2374 but those who disbelieve in the everlasting life deviate from the path
2375 if we had mercy on them and removed their afflictions they would still persist in their insolence blindly wandering
2376 already we have seized them with the punishment but they neither humbled themselves to their lord nor did they beseech him
2377 when we opened on them a gate of severe punishment they utterly despaired
2378 it was he who produced for you hearing eyes and hearts yet little is that you thank
2379 it was he who scattered you on the earth and before him you shall be gathered
2380 it is he who revives and makes to die and to him belong the alternation of the night and the day will you not understand
2381 no but they said what the ancients said before them
2382 when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we be resurrected
2383 we and our fathers have been promised this before it is but of the ancients fictitious tales
2384 say if you have knowledge to whom belongs the earth and whoever is in it 
2385 they will say to allah say then will you not remember
2386 say who is the lord of the seven heavens and of the great throne
2387 they will say allah say will you not be cautious
2388 say in whose hands is the kingdom of all things he protects and none protects against him if you have knowledge
2389 allah they will reply say how then can you be so bewitched
2390 no we have brought the truth to them but they are liars
2391 allah has not taken to himself any son there is no other god with him were this otherwise each god would have taken that which he created and some ofthem would have risen above others exalted is allah beyond that they describe
2392 he is the knower of the unseen and the seen high exalted be he above that they associate
2393 say lord if you should show me that which they are promised
2394 o my lord do not put me among the harmdoing people
2395 indeed we are able to show you that which we promised them
2396 repel evil with that which is better we know that which they describe
2397 and say o my lord i seek refuge in you from evil suggestions of the satans
2398 o my lord i seek refuge in you lest they attend me
2399 until when death comes to one of them he says my lord let me go back
23100 that i should do righteousness in that i forsook no it is only a word which he will speak behind them there shall stand a barrier till the day that they shall be resurrected
23101 and when the horn is blown on that day their ties of kindred shall be no more nor will they ask each other
23102 those whose scales are heavy shall prosper
23103 but those whose scales are light shall forfeit their souls and live in gehenna hell for ever
23104 the fire lashes their faces and therein are shriveled lips
23105 we shall say were my verses not recited to you and did you not belie them
23106 lord they will reply adversity prevailed over us and we were erring
23107 our lord bring us out of it if we return to sin then we shall indeed be harmdoers
23108 he will say slink there in it and do not speak to me
23109 among my worshipers there were a party who said lord we believed forgive us and have mercy on us you are the best of the merciful
23110 but you took them for laughingstock mocking at them until they caused you to forget my remembrance
23111 today i shall recompense them for their patience for it is they that have won
23112 and he will ask how many years did you live on earth
23113 they will reply a day or part of a day ask those who have kept count
23114 he will say you have tarried a little did you know
23115 did you think that we had created you only for play and that you would never be returned to us
23116 high exalted be allah the king the truth there is no god except he the lord of the noble throne
23117 whosoever calls upon another god other than allah having no proof his reckoning will be with his lord the unbelievers shall never prosper
23118 and say my lord forgive and have mercy for you are the best of the merciful
241 this is a chapter which we have sent down and appointed and in it we have sent down clear verses in order that you will remember
242 you shall lash the fornicatress and the fornicator each with a hundred lashes in the religion of allah let no tenderness for them seize you if you believe in allah and the last day and let their punishment be witnessed by a party of believers
243 the fornicator shall marry none but a fornicatress or an idolatress and the fornicatress none shall marry her but a fornicator or an idolater that is forbidden to the believers
244 those who accuse chaste women and cannot produce four witnesses you shall lash them with eighty lashes and never accept their testimony for they are evildoers
245 except those among them that afterwards repent and mend their ways allah is forgiving merciful
246 and those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses except themselves let them testify by swearing by allah four times that he is of the truthful
247 and the fifth time that the curse of allah shall be upon him if he should be of the liars
248 but the punishment will be averted from her if she swears four times that he is of the liars
249 and on the fifth time the wrath of allah shall be upon her if he is of the truthful
2410 if it were not for the bounty of allah to you and his mercy and that allah turns and is the wise
2411 those who came with the slander were a number of you do not regard it evil for you rather it is good for you every person of them shall have the sin that he has earned charged to him as for he who took upon himself the greater part there is a mightier punishment
2412 had you heard it and the believing men and women thought good thoughts about one another said this is a clear falsehood
2413 why did they not bring four witnesses against it but since they did not bring the witnesses before allah they are the liars
2414 but for the bounty of allah and his mercy towards you in this life and in the everlasting life you would have been sternly punished for that which you were involved
2415 you carried with your tongues and uttered with your mouths what you did not know you have thought it a trifle but before allah it was a mighty thing
2416 when you heard it why did you not say it is not right for us to speak of this exaltations to you this is a mighty slander
2417 allah exhorts you never again to repeat the like if you are believers
2418 allah makes plain to you his verses and allah is the knower the wise
2419 those who love that indecency should be broadcast about those who believe theirs is a painful punishment in this world and in the everlasting life allah knows and you do not know
2420 if it was not for the bounty of allah to you and his mercy and allah is the gentle the most merciful
2421 believers do not follow in the steps of satan for those who follow the steps of satan he bids to indecency and dishonor but for the bounty of allah to you and his mercy no one of you would ever have been purified but allah purifies whom he will allah is the hearer the knower
2422 do not let those of you who possess bounty and plenty swear not to give kinsmen and the poor and those who emigrate in the way of allah let them pardon and forgive do you not yearn that allah forgives you and allah is the forgiver the most merciful
2423 surely those who defame chaste unsuspecting believing women shall be cursed in this world and in the everlasting life and for them there is a mightypunishment
2424 on the day when their tongues hands and feet shall testify against them concerning what they were doing
2425 upon that day allah will pay them their due in full and they will know that allah is the clear truth
2426 evil women for evil men and evil men for evil women good women for good men and good men for good women these are clear of what has been said for them is forgiveness and a generous provision
2427 believers do not enter houses other than your houses until you first ask permission and greet with peace the people thereof that is better for you in order that you remember
2428 and if you do not find anyone there do not enter it until permission is given to you and if you are told return so return that is purer for you and allah knows the things you do
2429 there is no fault in you that you enter uninhabited houses wherein there is benefit for you allah knows what you reveal and what you hide
2430 say to the believers they should lower their gaze and guard their private parts that is purer for them allah is aware of the things they do
2431 and say to the believing women that they lower their gaze cast down their eyes and guard their chastity and do not reveal their adornment except that which is outward face and hands and let them draw their veils over their neck and not reveal their adornment except to their husbands or their fathers or their husbands fathers or their sons or their husbands sons or their brothers or their brothers sons or their sisters sons or their women or what their right hands own or such male attendants having no sexual desire or children who have not yet attained knowledge of womens private parts nor let them stamp their feet so that their hidden ornament is known and o believers turn to allah all together in order that you prosper
2432 marry those among you who are spouseless and the virtuous among your male and female slaves thereby freeing them if they are poor allah will enrichthem of his bounty allah is embracing knowing
2433 let those who do not find the means to marry be abstinent until allah enriches them of his bounty those your right hand owns who seek their freedom make a contract with them accordingly if you know some good in them and give them from the wealth of allah that he has given you do not force your slavegirls into prostitution in order to seek worldly gain for they wish to preserve their chastity whosoever compels them surely allah after their being compelled is the forgiver to the girls the most merciful
2434 now we have sent down to you clarifying verses and an example of those who passed away before you and admonition to the cautious
2435 allah is the lighter of the heavens and the earth the example of his light is like a tube in which there is a wick the wick is in a lamp and the lamp is as a glittering planet kindled from a blessed tree an olive that is neither of the east nor of the west its oil would almost shine forth though no fire touched it light upon light allah guides to his light whom he will allah strikes parables for people allah has knowledge of all things
2436 in houses which allah has allowed to be raised up and his name to be remembered therein in the morning and evening
2437 are men who exalt him there whom neither trade nor sale can divert from the remembrance of allah and establish the prayers and pay the obligatorycharity fearing a day when hearts and eyes shall be turned about
2438 that allah will recompense them for the finest deeds they did and increase them from his bounty allah provides without measure to whom he will
2439 as for the unbelievers their works are like a mirage in the wilderness the thirsty person thinks it is water but when he comes near he finds that it is nothing he finds allah there who pays him his account in full allah is swift in reckoning
2440 or they are like darkness upon a deep sea covered with a wave above which is another wave above which are clouds darkness piled one upon the other when he stretches out his hand he can scarcely see it indeed to whomsoever allah assigns no light he shall have no light
2441 have you not seen how allah is exalted by those in the heavens and earth and the birds with outspread wings he knows its prayers and its exaltations and allah has knowledge of the things they do
2442 to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth to him is the arrival
2443 have you not seen how allah drives the clouds then gathers them and converts them into a mass then you see rain coming from the midst of them and he sends down out of heaven mountains in which there is hail pelting with it whom he will and turning it away from whom he will the flash of its lightning almost snatches away the sight
2444 allah turns about the night and the day to succeed one another surely in this there is a lesson for those who have eyes
2445 allah created everything that walks from water some creep upon their bellies others walk on two feet and others walk on four allah creates whatever he will allah is powerful over everything
2446 we have sent down clarifying verses allah guides whom he will to a straight path
2447 they say we believe in allah and the messenger and obey but a party of them turn away after this those are not believers
2448 and when they are called to allah and his messenger so that he judges between them a party of them swerve away
2449 if the right is theirs they would have hastened to him obediently
2450 is there a sickness in their hearts or are they in doubt do they fear that allah and his messenger will be unjust no but those they are the harmdoers
2451 but when the believers are called to allah and his messenger in order that he judges between them their reply is we hear and obey such are theprosperous
2452 those who obey allah and his messenger and fear allah and have awe of him shall be the winners
2453 they swear by allah in the most earnest oaths that if you order them they would go forth say do not swear known obedience is better allah is aware of the things you do
2454 say obey allah and obey the messenger if you turn away upon him only rests what is laid upon him and upon you rests what is laid on you if you obey him you shall be guided it is only for the messenger to deliver a clear message
2455 allah has promised those of you who believe and do good works that he will indeed make them successors in the land as he made those who were before them successors and that he will indeed establish their religion for them that which he has approved for them and will exchange safety for them after their fear they worship me and associate nothing with me after that those who disbelieve are the impious
2456 establish the prayers pay the charity and obey the messenger in order to have mercy
2457 never think that the unbelievers will be able to frustrate us in the earth their refuge is the fire an evil arrival
2458 believers let those your right hand owns and those who have not come of age ask permission of you three times before the dawn prayer when you put aside your garments in the heat of noon and after the night prayer these are the three occasions of privacy there is no fault in you or them apart from these that they go about you you are of each other as such allah makes plain to you his verses allah is the knower the wise
2459 and when children reach the age of puberty let them ask permission as those before them asked permission as such allah makes clear to you his verses allah is the knower the wise
2460 as for women that are past childbearing who have no hope of marriage there is no fault in them that they discard their cloaks provided they do not reveal their adornments but it is better if they abstain allah is the hearer the knower
2461 it shall be no fault for the blind the lame the sick and yourselves to eat from your houses nor the houses of your fathers your mothers your brothers your sisters your paternal uncles your paternal aunts your maternal uncles your maternal aunts or in houses the keys of which you own or in those of your friend there is no fault in you that you all eat together or separately when you enter houses greet with peace one another with a salutation from allah blessed and good as such allah makes clear to you his verses so that you understand
2462 the believers are only those who believe in allah and his messenger and who when gathered with him upon a common matter do not depart till they have asked his permission surely those who ask your permission are those who believe in allah and his messenger when they ask your permission for some of their affairs grant it to whomever you please and ask allah for forgiveness for them allah is the forgiver the merciful
2463 do not make the calling of the messenger among yourselves like your calling to one another allah knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously so let those who disobey his command beware lest they are struck by sedition or they are stricken with a painful punishment
2464 to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth he has knowledge of what state you are upon on the day when they shall be returned to him he will tell them all what they have done and allah has knowledge of everything
251 blessed is he who has sent down the criterion to his worshiper prophet muhammad that he is a warner to all mankind
252 to whom the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs who has not taken a son nor does he have an associate in the kingdom and he created everything then he ordained it very precisely
253 yet they worship other than him gods which cannot create anything and were themselves created they own neither harm nor benefit for themselves neither do they own death nor life nor a resurrection
254 the unbelievers say this is but a falsehood he has forged another nation has helped him so they have come with wrong and falsehood
255 they say he has written tales of the ancients they are recited to him at dawn and at the evening
256 say it was sent down by him who knows the secrets of heavens and earth he is forgiving the most merciful
257 they also say how is it that this messenger eats food and walks about the markets why has no angel been sent down with him to warn us
258 or why has no treasure been thrown to him or a garden for him to eat from and the harmdoers say the man you follow is surely bewitched
259 see how they strike examples for you surely they have gone astray and are unable to find a way
2510 blessed be he who if he wills can assign you better things than these gardens underneath which rivers flow and he shall assign for you palaces
2511 no they belied the hour we have prepared for him who belied the hour a blaze
2512 when it sees them from a far off place they shall hear it raging and sighing
2513 and when chained in iron fetters they are cast into some narrow space of the fire they will call out for destruction
2514 do not call out today for one destruction call out for many destructions
2515 say is that better or the garden of eternity which the cautious have been promised it is their recompense and their arrival
2516 living there for ever they shall find in it all that they desire that is a promise binding upon your lord and to be asked of him
2517 on the day when he gathers them with all that they worship other than allah he will say was it you who misled my worshipers or did they themselves go astray
2518 they will answer exaltations to you we should not have taken others for a guardian but you gave them and their fathers enjoyment until they forgot your remembrance and they were a destroyed nation
2519 so they belie what you say and you can neither turn it aside nor find any help those of you who have done evil we let them taste a great punishment
2520 we did not send messengers before you but that they ate food and walked about in the markets we have appointed some of you to be a trial for others will you endure your lord is the seer
2521 those who do not hope to meet us ask why have no angels been sent to us why can we not see our lord how proud they are within themselves and have become greatly disdainful
2522 on the day when they behold the angels there will be no glad tidings for the sinners they will say a refuge which is forbidden
2523 then we shall advance upon the work which they have done and render it as scattered dust
2524 on that day the companions of paradise will have a better abode and a finer restingplace
2525 on that day the heaven is split asunder with clouds and the angels are sent down in majesty
2526 the true kingdom on that day shall belong to the merciful a harsh day for the unbelievers
2527 upon that day the harmdoer shall bite his hands and say would that i had taken a path with the messenger
2528 would that i had never chosen soandso for my companion
2529 he led me astray from the remembrance after it had reached me satan is ever the foresaker of humans
2530 the messenger says o my lord my people have taken this koran while deserting it
2531 to every prophet we have appointed an enemy among the harmdoers your lord is sufficient for you a guide and a helper
2532 the unbelievers ask why was the koran not sent down to him all at once as such we strengthen your heart thereby and we have recited it very distinctly
2533 they do not bring to you any parable but that which we bring to you is the truth and better in explanation
2534 those who will be gathered into gehenna hell upon their faces shall be in the worst in place and have gone further astray from the path
2535 we gave the book to moses and gave him his brother aaron as a minister
2536 then we said go to the nation who have belied our signs and we utterly destroyed them
2537 the nation of noah we drowned them when they belied their messenger and made of them a sign to the nation for the harmdoers we have prepared a painful punishment
2538 also to aad and thamood and the nation of errass and many generations in between
2539 to each of them we gave examples and each of them we utterly ruined
2540 they have surely passed by the village which was rained upon by evil rain of stones what have they never seen it no they look for no resurrection
2541 whenever they see you they mock you saying is this whom allah has sent as a messenger
2542 he would have mislead us from our gods if we had not been steadfast to them but they shall know who is further astray from the path when they see the punishment
2543 have you seen him who has made gods of his own desires would you be a guardian over him
2544 do you think that most of them can hear or understand they are like cattle no they are further astray from the path
2545 do you not see how your lord stretches the shadow had it been his will he could have made it constant then he appointed the sun to be a guide to it
2546 thereafter we seize it to us withdrawing it gently
2547 it is he who has appointed the night a mantle for you and sleep for a rest the day he has appointed for rising
2548 it is he who loosens the winds bearing glad tidings before the hands of his mercy and we have sent down pure water from the heaven
2549 so that with it we revive dead lands and provide drink for the cattle and the human we created
2550 we have indeed turned it about them so that they remember yet most people refuse all except disbelief
2551 had it been our will we could have raised a warner in every village
2552 so do not obey the unbelievers but struggle mightily with it the koran
2553 it was he who let forth the two seas this one is palatably sweet and this salt a bitter taste and he set a barrier between them and a refuge which is forbidden
2554 and it is he who created the human from water and gave him kindred of blood and of marriage your lord is the powerful
2555 yet they the unbelievers worship other than allah that which can neither benefit nor harm them surely the unbeliever is ever a partisan against his lord
2556 we did not send you but as a bearer of glad tidings and as a warner
2557 say i demand of you no wage for this except for he who wishes to take the path to his lord
2558 put your trust in the all living who never dies and exalt with his praise he is sufficiently aware of his worshipers sins
2559 it is he who in six days created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them and then he willed to the throne the merciful ask about him from he who knows him
2560 when it is said to them prostrate yourselves before the merciful they ask and what is the merciful shall we prostrate ourselves to whatever you bid us and it increases their aversion
2561 blessed be he who has set the constellations in the heaven and set amongst them a sun and an illuminating moon
2562 it is he who has made the night and day follow each other for those whom he desires to remember or he desires to be thankful
2563 the worshipers of the merciful are those who walk humbly on the earth and when the ignorant address them say peace
2564 who pass the night prostrating and standing to their lord
2565 who say our lord turn from us the punishment of gehenna for its punishment is the most terrible
2566 it is an evil settling and an evil residence
2567 who when they spend are neither wasteful nor miserly between that is a just stand
2568 who do not call upon another god with allah nor slay the soul which allah has forbidden except by right who do not fornicate for he who does this shall face punishment
2569 doubled for him on the day of resurrection is his punishment and therein he shall live humbled
2570 except he who repents and believes and does good works those allah will change their evil deeds into good deeds allah is ever forgiving and merciful
2571 he who repents and does good works truly turns to allah in repentance
2572 and those who do not bear false witness and when they pass by idle talk pass by with honor
2573 and who when they are reminded of the verses of their lord they do not fall down deaf and blind
2574 those who say lord give us of our wives and children what pleases our eyes and make us leaders to the fearful
2575 those shall be recompensed with the highest rank for their patience there they shall receive a greeting and peace
2576 there they shall live for ever a fine dwelling place and residence
2577 say my lord cares little for you if it was not for your supplication indeed you have belied the messenger and the koran so it the punishment will be fastened
261 taseenmeem
262 those are the verses of the clear book
263 perhaps you consume yourself that they are not believers
264 if we will we can send down on them a sign from heaven before which their necks will remain humbled
265 a fresh remembrance has never come to them from the merciful except they turn away from it
266 so they belied but surely the tidings of that they mocked will come to them
267 have they not seen the earth how many we caused to grow in it every generous kind
268 surely in this there is a sign yet most of them do not believe
269 your lord he is the almighty the most merciful
2610 and when your lord called to moses saying go to the harmdoing nation
2611 the nation of pharaoh will they not fear me
2612 my lord he replied i fear they will belie me
2613 and my chest will become constricted and my tongue will not be loosed in my speech therefore send to aaron
2614 they hold a sin against me and i fear that they will kill me
2615 he said never so go both of you with our signs we shall be with you listening
2616 go both to pharaoh and both of you say to him we are each a messenger from the lord of all the worlds
2617 send forth with us the children of israel
2618 he pharaoh said to moses did we not bring you up when you were a child and have you not spent years of your life amongst us
2619 yet you were ungrateful and have done the deed you did
2620 he moses replied indeed i did that when i was among those who stray
2621 i fled from you because i feared you but my lord has given me judgment and made me one of the messengers
2622 is this then the blessing with which you reproach me that you have the children of israel for worshipers
2623 pharaoh said and what is the lord of the worlds
2624 he moses replied is the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if you believe
2625 do you not hear said he pharaoh to those around him
2626 he said your lord and the lord of your fathers the ancients
2627 pharaoh said surely the messenger who has been sent to you is mad
2628 he is the lord of the east and the west said he moses and all that is between them if you could understand
2629 if you take any other god except myself he pharaoh replied you shall be thrown into prison
2630 what even if i brought you something clear said he moses
2631 he pharaoh replied show us your sign if you are of the truthful
2632 he cast down his staff and thereupon it was a clear serpent
2633 then he drew out his hand and it was luminous to the onlookers
2634 this said he pharaoh to his council is a cunning sorcerer
2635 who seeks to expel you from your land by his sorcery what is your counsel
2636 they replied put him and his brother off for a while and send heralds to your cities
2637 to bring every knowledgeable sorcerer
2638 the sorcerers were gathered at the appointed time on a wellknown day
2639 and the people were asked will you gather
2640 in order that we shall follow the sorcerers if they are the victors
2641 then when the sorcerers came to pharaoh they said shall we receive a wage if we win
2642 yes indeed he answered and you shall become among those who are near stationed
2643 moses said to them cast down what you cast
2644 so they cast their ropes and staffs saying by pharaohs might we shall be the victors
2645 then moses cast down his staff and it swallowed up their lying invention
2646 so the sorcerers were cast down prostrating themselves
2647 saying we believe in the lord of the worlds
2648 the lord of moses and aaron
2649 he pharaoh said you have believed him before i have given you permission he is the chief of you who has taught you sorcery but you shall know i will surely cut off on opposite sides a hand and a foot and crucify you all
2650 there is no harm they replied for surely to our lord we are turning
2651 we are eager that our lord should forgive us our offenses for we are the first of the believers
2652 also we revealed to moses saying go with my worshipers by night for you will be followed
2653 then pharaoh sent gatherers to the cities
2654 these they said are a small band
2655 they have enraged us
2656 and we are a host on our guard
2657 as such we expelled them from their gardens and their fountains
2658 their treasures and a noble station
2659 as such we gave it to the children of israel
2660 at sunrise they followed them
2661 and when the two hosts came in view of each other moses companions said we have been reached
2662 no indeed he replied my lord is with me and he will guide me
2663 then we revealed to moses strike the sea with your staff so it divided and each part was as a mighty mount
2664 and there we brought the others on
2665 and we saved moses and those who were with him together
2666 then we drowned the others
2667 surely in that there is a sign yet most of them do not believe
2668 surely your lord is the almighty the most merciful
2669 and recite to them the news of abraham
2670 he said to his father and to his nation what do you worship
2671 they replied we worship idols and continue cleaving to them
2672 do they hear you when you call on them he asked
2673 can they benefit you or harm you
2674 they replied no but we found our fathers doing so
2675 he said have you considered what you worship
2676 you and your elderly fathers
2677 they are enemies to me except the lord of all the worlds
2678 who created me and he guides me
2679 and he gives me to eat and drink
2680 who when i am sick heals me
2681 who makes me to die and then revives me
2682 and whom i am eager shall forgive me my sins on the day of recompense
2683 my lord give me judgment and join me with the righteous
2684 and appoint me a tongue of truthfulness among the latter
2685 and place me amongst the inheritors of the garden of bliss
2686 and forgive my father for he was among the astray
2687 do not degrade me on the day when they are resurrected
2688 the day when neither wealth nor sons shall benefit
2689 except him who comes before allah with a pure heart
2690 and paradise shall be brought forward to the cautious
2691 and hell is brought near to the perverse
2692 it will be said to them where is that you worshipped
2693 other than allah do they help you or even help themselves
2694 and they will be pitched into it they and the perverse
2695 and the hosts of iblis all together
2696 and they will say while they dispute with one another
2697 by allah we were certainly in clear error
2698 when we made you equal with the lord of the worlds
2699 it was nothing but the evildoers who led us astray
26100 we have no intercessors now
26101 no caring friend
26102 would that we might return again and be among the believers
26103 surely in that there is a sign yet most of them do not believe
26104 surely your lord is the almighty the most merciful
26105 the nation of noah belied their messengers
26106 when noah their brother said to them will you not be cautious
26107 i am for you an honest messenger
26108 so fear allah and obey me
26109 for this i ask of you no wage for my wage falls only on the lord of the worlds
26110 so fear allah and obey me
26111 they replied are we to believe you whom the lowliest follow
26112 he said i have no knowledge of what they have done
26113 their account falls only upon my lord if you were but aware
26114 i will not drive away the believers
26115 i am only a clear warner
26116 noah they replied if you do not desist you shall be of those stoned
26117 he said my lord my nation have belied me
26118 so open between me and them an opening and save me and the believers who are with me
26119 we saved him and those who were with him in the laden ship
26120 afterwards we drowned the rest
26121 surely in that there is a sign yet most of them do not believe
26122 your lord is the almighty the most merciful
26123 the nation of aad belied their messengers
26124 when their brother hood said to them will you not be cautious
26125 i am for you an honest messenger
26126 fear allah and obey me
26127 for this i ask of you no wage for my wage falls only on the lord of the worlds
26128 do you build over each high place a sign to amuse yourselves
26129 and do you take to yourselves underground reservoirs in order to live for ever
26130 when you assault you assault like tyrants
26131 so fear allah and obey me
26132 fear him who has given you all the things you know
26133 he has given you flocks and sons
26134 gardens and fountains
26135 indeed i fear for you the punishment of a dreadful day
26136 they replied it is the same to us whether you admonish or whether you are not one of the admonishers
26137 that is nothing but a habit of the ancients
26138 and we shall never be punished
26139 so they belied him so we destroyed them surely in that there is a sign yet most of them do not believe
26140 surely your lord is the almighty the most merciful
26141 thamood belied their messengers
26142 their brother salih said to them will you not be cautious
26143 i am for you an honest messenger
26144 so fear allah and obey me
26145 for this i ask of you no wage my wage falls only upon the lord of the worlds
26146 will you be left secure in this
26147 amidst gardens and fountains
26148 sown fields and palmtrees with slender spathes
26149 will you still hew your dwellings in the mountains
26150 so fear allah and obey me
26151 do not obey the order of the wasteful
26152 who corrupt in the earth and do not reform
26153 they replied surely you are one of those bewitched
26154 you are but a human like ourselves produce for us a sign if you are of the truthful
26155 he said here is a shecamel she shall have her share of water as you have yours on an appointed day
26156 do not touch her with malice so that punishment of a dreadful day seizes you
26157 yet they hamstrung her and in the morning they were remorseful
26158 and the punishment seized them surely in that there is a sign yet most of them do not believe
26159 your lord he is the almighty the most merciful
26160 lots nation belied their messengers
26161 when their brother lot said to them will you not be cautious
26162 i am for you an honest messenger
26163 so fear allah and obey me
26164 i ask of you no wage for this my wage is only with the lord of the worlds
26165 what do you come to the males of the world
26166 and leave your wives whom your lord has created for you no but you are a transgressing nation
26167 lot they replied if you do not desist you shall be thrown out
26168 he said truly i am a detester of what you do
26169 my lord save me and my people from that they are doing
26170 so we saved him and all his people
26171 except an old woman who stayed behind
26172 then we destroyed the others
26173 we rained upon them a rain and evil is the rain of stones on those that are warned
26174 surely in that there is a sign yet most of them do not believe
26175 your lord he is the almighty the most merciful
26176 the dwellers of the thicket belied their messengers
26177 shuaib said to them will you not be cautious
26178 i am for you an honest messenger
26179 so fear allah and obey me
26180 i ask of you no wage for this my wage is only with the lord of the worlds
26181 fill up the measure do not be among the cheats
26182 and weigh with the straight scale
26183 and do not diminish the goods of the people and do not make mischief in the earth working corruption
26184 fear he who created you and the generations of the ancient
26185 they replied you are surely one of those bewitched
26186 you are but a human like ourselves we think that you are one of the liars
26187 drop down on us lumps from heaven if you are one of the truthful
26188 he said my lord knows what you are doing
26189 but they belied him then the punishment of the day of shadow raining fire seized them truly it was the punishment of a dreadful day
26190 surely in that there is a sign yet most of them do not believe
26191 your lord he is the almighty the most merciful
26192 truly it is the sending of the lord of the worlds
26193 the honest spirit gabriel brought it down
26194 upon your heart prophet muhammad in order to be one of the warners
26195 in a clear arabic tongue
26196 truly it is in the books of the ancients
26197 was it not a sign for them known to the learned of the children of israel
26198 if we had revealed it to a nonarab
26199 and he had recited it to them they would not have believed
26200 even so we have caused it to enter into the hearts of harmdoers
26201 they shall not believe in it until they see the painful punishment
26202 so that it will come upon them suddenly while they are unaware
26203 and then they will say shall we be respited
26204 do they wish to hasten our punishment
26205 what do you see if we gave them enjoyment for years
26206 and then what they were promised comes to them
26207 what avail will their past enjoyments be to them
26208 we never destroyed a village that did not have warners
26209 for a reminder and we never harmed
26210 it was not the satans who brought it down
26211 it is not for them nor are they able
26212 truly they are expelled from hearing
26213 so do not call upon another god with allah lest you should be one of those who are punished
26214 warn your tribe and your near kinsmen
26215 and lower your wing to the believers who follow you
26216 if they disobey you say i am quit of what you do
26217 put your trust in the almighty the most merciful
26218 who sees you when you stand
26219 and when you turn among those who prostrate themselves
26220 surely he is the hearer the knower
26221 shall i tell you on whom the satans descend
26222 they descend on every guilty impostor
26223 they listen but most of them are liars
26224 poets are followed by the perverse
26225 have you not seen how they wander in every valley
26226 and they say what they do not do
26227 except those who believe and do good works and remember allah in abundance and became victorious after they had been wronged the wrongdoers will surely know which turn they will be returning to hell
271 taseen those are the verses of the koran a clear book
272 a guidance and glad tidings to believers
273 who establish their prayers and pay the obligatory charity and are certain of the everlasting life
274 as for those who do not believe in the everlasting life we have decorated for them their works and they wander blindly
275 such are those for whom there is an evil punishment and in the everlasting life are the greatest losers
276 you have received the koran from the wise the knower
277 when moses said to his household indeed i can see a fire far away i will go and bring you news of it or i will bring you a lighted flame so that you can warm yourselves
278 and when he came near it he was called blessed be who is moses in the fire and the angels who are around it exaltations to allah lord of the worlds
279 moses it is i allah the almighty the wise
2710 cast down your staff and when he saw it writhing like a serpent he turned about retreating and did not turn back moses do not fear indeed themessengers do not fear when they are with me
2711 except he who has done evil then after evil has changed into good i am the forgiving most merciful
2712 put your hand inside your collar and it will come out luminous without evil among the nine signs to pharaoh and his nation indeed they were an impious nation
2713 but when our signs came to them visibly they said this is plain sorcery
2714 they denied them unjustly out of pride though their souls acknowledged them see how was the end of the corrupt workers
2715 we gave knowledge to david and solomon they said praise be to allah who has preferred us above many of his believing worshipers
2716 solomon inherited david he said know my people we have been taught the speech of birds and given everything surely this is a clear bounty
2717 we gathered to solomon his army of jinn humans and birds gathered and dispersed
2718 and when they came to the valley of the ants an ant said ants go into your dwellings lest solomon and his army should unknowingly crush you
2719 he smiled and laughed at its words and said my lord inspire me that i should be thankful for your blessing with which you have blessed me and my parents and that i may do good works that will please you admit me by your mercy among your righteous worshipers
2720 he reviewed the birds and said why is it that i do not see the hoopoe here or is he among the absent
2721 surely i will punish him with a terrible punishment or i will slaughter him or he gives me a good reason
2722 he was not long in coming and said i know what you do not know i come to you from sheba with certain news
2723 there i found a woman ruling over them she possess everything and has a great throne
2724 but she and her people prostrate to the sun instead of allah and satan has made their deeds seem pleasing to them and barred them from the path and therefore they are not guided
2725 do they not prostrate themselves to allah who brings forth all that is concealed in the heavens and earth and he knows what they hide and what they reveal
2726 allah there is no god except he the lord of the mighty throne
2727 he replied we shall see if what you have said is true or whether you are among those who lie
2728 take my letter and drop it to them then turn aside and see what they shall return
2729 she the queen of sheba said o council look an honorable letter has been dropped to me
2730 it is from solomon and it is in the name of allah the merciful the most merciful
2731 do not rise up against me but come to me in surrender muslims
2732 she said o council let me hear your counsel concerning my affairs for i am not used to deciding an affair until you bear me witness
2733 they replied we are possessors of force and great might it is for you to command so consider what you will
2734 she said when kings enter a village they ruin it and humiliate its nobles and this they will do
2735 but i shall send them a gift and see what the messengers bring back
2736 but when he came to solomon he said is it wealth that you would give me when allah has given me that which is better than he has given to you no but instead you rejoice in your gift
2737 go back then we shall surely come against them with soldiers of which they have no power to oppose and we shall drive them from there abased and humiliated
2738 and he said o council which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me muslims submissive to allah
2739 an efreet an extremely strong jinn among the jinn replied i will bring it to you before you rise from your place i have the strength and am trustworthy
2740 but he who had knowledge of the book said i will bring it to you before your glance comes back to you and when he saw it set before him he solomon said this is a favor from my lord that he might test me whether i am thankful or ungrateful whosoever gives thanks gives thanks only for his own souls good but he who is ungrateful truly my lord is rich and generous
2741 then he said let her throne be disguised so that we can see whether she is guided or if she is among those who are not guided
2742 and when she came she was asked is your throne like this and she replied it looks like it and we were given the knowledge before her and weremuslims
2743 that which she worshipped other than allah had prevented her for she came from an unbelieving nation
2744 it was said to her enter the pavilion and when she saw it she thought it was a pool of water and bared her legs but he said it is a pavilion smoothed with crystal she said my lord i have wronged myself and i become a muslim submissive with solomon to allah lord of the worlds
2745 to thamood we sent their brother salih saying worship allah but they were two parties in dispute with one another
2746 my nation he said why do you wish to hasten evil rather than good why do you not ask the forgiveness of allah in order that you find mercy
2747 they said we predict an evil omen from you and those who are with you he replied your prediction is with allah you are a nation being tested
2748 in the city there were nine people who were corrupting the land and did not reform
2749 they said let us swear by allah to attack him and his family at night then we will tell his guardian we were not witnesses of the destruction of his family and surely we are truthful
2750 and they devised a scheme and without their knowledge we devised a scheme
2751 and behold the consequences of their devising we destroyed them and their nation altogether
2752 those are their houses all are in ruins because of the evil they committed surely in this there is a sign for nation who know
2753 and we saved those who believed and were cautious
2754 and lot he said to his nation do you commit indecencies with your eyes open
2755 do you approach men lustfully instead of women no you are an ignorant nation
2756 yet the only answer of his nation was that they said expel the family of lot from your village they are people who purified themselves
2757 so we saved him and his family except his wife whom we decreed should stay behind
2758 and we rained on them a rain of stones indeed it is an evil rain that rains on those that are warned
2759 say praise belongs to allah and peace be upon his worshipers whom he has chosen who is more worthier allah or that which they associate
2760 is he who created the heavens and the earth and sent water from the sky for you and caused gardens to grow full of beauty of which its tree you could never grow is there a god with allah no but they are a nation who set up equals with him
2761 who has established the earth a fixed place and set therein rivers and set for it firm mountains and placed a barrier between the two seas is there a god with allah no most of them are without knowledge
2762 who answers the oppressed when he supplicates to him and removes evil and appoints you as inheritors of the earth is there a god with allah how little you remember
2763 who guides you in the darkness of the land and sea and sends the winds bearing glad tidings of his mercy is there a god with allah exalted is allah above what they associate
2764 who originates creation then brings it back again who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth is there a god with allah say bring us your proof if you are among the truthful
2765 say none in the heavens or the earth knows the unseen except allah and they are not aware when they shall be resurrected
2766 no their knowledge fails them as to the everlasting life no they are in doubt about it no they are blind to it
2767 the unbelievers say when we and our fathers are turned to dust shall we be brought forth
2768 we were promised this before and so were our fathers it is but the fictitious story of the ancients
2769 say journey in the land and see what was the end of the sinners
2770 do not be sorry for them nor be distressed for what they devise
2771 and they ask when will this promise come if what you say is true
2772 say it may be that part of what you seek to hasten on is already riding behind you
2773 surely your lord is bountiful to the people yet most of them do not give thanks
2774 surely your lord knows what they hide in their hearts and what they reveal
2775 there is not a thing hidden in the heaven and earth except that it is in a clear book
2776 surely this koran relates to the children of israel most of that which they are at variance
2777 it is a guidance and a mercy to believers
2778 surely by his judgement your lord will decide between them he is the mighty the knower
2779 therefore put your trust in allah for you are upon a clear truth
2780 you do not make the dead hear nor do you make the deaf hear you call when they turn about retreating
2781 nor do you guide the blind out of their error nor do you make any to hear except those who believe in our verses and are muslims
2782 and when the word falls on them we will bring out from the earth a beast that shall speak to them indeed the people were not certain of our verses
2783 on that day we shall gather a crowd from every nation of those who belied our verses so they are gathered
2784 when they have come he will say did you belie my verses although you knew nothing or what was it you were doing
2785 and the word shall fall upon them because of the evil they committed and they shall be speechless
2786 have they not seen how we have made the night for them to rest in and the day to see surely there are signs in this for the nation who believe
2787 on the day the horn shall be blown all who live in the heavens and earth will be terrified except those whom allah wills all shall come to him humbled
2788 and you will see the mountains which you think to be firm pass by like clouds such is the making of allah who has created everything well he is aware of the things you do
2789 whosoever comes with a good deed shall have better than it and shall be secure from the terrors of that day
2790 but those who come with an evil deed shall have their faces thrust into the fire are you recompensed except for your deeds
2791 say prophet muhammad i am only ordered to worship the lord of this country which he has made sacred everything belongs to him and i am ordered to be of the muslims
2792 and to recite the koran whosoever is guided is only guided for himself and to whosoever goes astray say i am only a warner
2793 and say praise belongs to allah he will show you his signs and you will recognize them your lord is not inattentive of what you do
281 taseenmeem
282 those are the verses of the clear book
283 we shall in truth recite to you some of the news of moses and pharaoh for a nation who believe
284 pharaoh had exalted himself in the land and had divided its people into sects one group he abased putting their sons to death and sparing their women for he was one of those who corrupted
285 but we wanted to be gracious to those abased in the land and to make them leaders and inheritors
286 and to establish them in the land and to show pharaoh and haman and their armies the very thing they dreaded
287 we revealed this to moses mother suckle him but when you fear for him cast him into the water neither fear nor sorrow because we shall restore him to you and make him among the messengers
288 then the family of pharaoh picked him out to be an enemy and a sorrow for them indeed pharaoh and haman and their army were sinners
289 pharaohs wife said to him he will be a comfort to me and you do not slay him perhaps he may benefit us or we will take him for our son but they were unaware
2810 in the morning the heart of moses mother became empty she would have revealed who he was had we not settled her heart so that she might be among the believers
2811 she said to his sister follow him and she watched him from a distance but they were unaware
2812 we had forbidden to him before that he should be suckled by foster mothers therefore she moses sister said to them shall i direct you to a people of a household who will take charge of him for you and advise him
2813 so we restored him to his mother so that she might be comforted and not sorrow and that she might know that the promise of allah is true yet most of them do not know
2814 and when he was full grown and reached the perfection of his strength we gave him judgment and knowledge as such we recompense the gooddoers
2815 and he entered the city unnoticed by the people and found two men fighting one was of his own party and the other of his enemies the one of his party appealed for his help against his enemy moses struck and killed him and said this is the work of satan he is surely a clear misleading enemy
2816 forgive me my lord for i have wronged myself and so he forgave him for he is indeed the forgiving the most merciful
2817 he said my lord as you have favored me i will never be a helper to the wrongdoer
2818 in the morning he was in the city fearful and vigilant then he whom he had helped the day before cried out to him again for help clearly said moses you are quarrelsome
2819 and when moses was about to seize he who was the enemy of both of them he said moses would you kill me as you killed a living soul yesterday you desire only to be a tyrant in the land and you do not want to be among the reformers
2820 then a man came running from the furthest part of the city moses he said the assembly are plotting to kill you leave for i am one of your sincere advisers
2821 so he left fearful and vigilant saying my lord save me from the harmdoing nation
2822 and when he turned his face towards midian he said it may be that my lord will guide me on the right way
2823 when he came to the water wells of midian he found there some people drawing water and he found two women apart from them who were keeping back their flocks what is your business he asked they replied we cannot draw water until the shepherds have driven away their flocks and our father is an elderly man
2824 so he drew water for them and then retired to the shade saying o my lord surely i have need of whatever good you send me
2825 then one of the two came to him walking shyly and said my father invites you so that he can recompense you with a wage for having drawn water for us so when he came to him and told him his story the father said do not be afraid you have been saved from the nation of harmdoers
2826 one of the two women said father hire him the best who you can hire is the strong the honest
2827 he said i will let you marry one of these two daughters of mine on condition that you hire yourself to me for eight years if you complete ten that is of your own accord i shall not press you surely you will find me if allah wills among the good
2828 so be it between me and you said moses whichever of the two terms i fulfill it will be no injustice to me allah is the guardian of what we say
2829 and when moses had fulfilled the term and departed with his household he saw from far away on the side of the tor a fire he said to his household stay here for i can see a fire perhaps i can bring you news or a flame from the fire so that you can warm yourselves
2830 when he came to it he was called from the right bank in the blessed plot of the tree he heard speech without letter or voice coming from all directionsmoses i am allah lord of the worlds
2831 cast down your staff and when he saw his staff writhing as though it were a serpent he turned about in retreat and did not turn back o moses approach and have no fear you are surely safe
2832 put your hand in the neck of your shirt it will come out luminous unharmed and draw your arm to you so that you are not afraid these are two signs from your lord to pharaoh and his assembly surely they were an impious nation
2833 my lord said moses i have killed a living soul among them and fear that they will slay me
2834 aaron my brother has a more eloquent tongue than i please send him with me as a helper to confirm i speak truly i fear that they will belie me
2835 he said we will strengthen your arm with your brother and appoint for you both an authority so that they shall not reach you with our signs you and those who follow you shall be the victors
2836 and when moses came to them with our clear signs they said this is nothing but forged sorcery we have never heard of this among our fathers the ancients
2837 moses replied my lord knows well who brings guidance from him and who shall possess the last residence the harmdoers will not prosper
2838 assembly said pharaoh i do not know that you have any god except me o haman kindle a fire upon clay and make me a tower so that i can climb to see the god of moses i think that he is one of the liars
2839 he and his hosts became wrongfully proud in the land and they thought that they would never be returned to us
2840 therefore we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea see how was the end of the harmdoers
2841 we made them leaders inviting to the fire and on the day of resurrection they shall not be victors
2842 in this world we laid our curse on them and on the day of resurrection they shall be among the exiled
2843 and we gave moses the book after we had destroyed the former generations to be reflections for people and a guidance and a mercy in order that they might remember
2844 prophet muhammad you were not on the western side of the mountain when we decreed the commandment to moses nor were you among thosewitnessing
2845 we raised generations who lived long you did not live among the people of midian nor did you recite to them our verses but we were sendingmessengers
2846 you were not present on the side of the tor when we called yet as a mercy from your lord to warn a nation to whom no warner has been sent before in order that they remember
2847 and not say when evil befalls them on account of that which their hands forwarded our lord why did you not send a messenger to us so that we might follow your verses and so that we might be among the believers
2848 so when the truth prophet muhammad came to them from us they said why is he not given the like of that which was given to moses but did they not also disbelieve in that which moses was given before they say about moses and aaron two sorcerers supporting one another and they said we disbelieve both
2849 say if what you say is true bring down from allah a book that is a better guidance than both i will follow it
2850 if they do not answer you know that they are only following their desires and who is further astray than he who is led by his desires without guidance fromallah allah does not guide the harmdoers
2851 we have brought them the word in order that they remember
2852 those to whom we gave the book before believe in it
2853 when it is recited to them they say we believe in it because it is the truth from our lord we surrendered ourselves before it came
2854 their wage shall be given them twice because they have endured patiently averting evil with good and spending from what we have given them
2855 and because when they hear idle talk they turn away from it and say we have our deeds and you have your deeds peace be upon you we do not desire the ignorant
2856 you cannot guide whom you please it is allah who guides whom he will he knows well those who are guided
2857 they say if we follow the guidance with you we shall be driven from our land but have we not given them a secure sanctuary from which fruits of every kind are collected as a provision from us indeed most of them do not know
2858 how many a village have we destroyed that were ungrateful in their life those are their dwellings they are uninhabited after them except for a little we are the inheritors
2859 nor did your lord destroy the villages until he had sent a messenger to its mother village reciting to them our verses we never destroyed villages unless their inhabitants were harmdoers
2860 the things you have been given and its adornments are but the enjoyment of this present life what is with allah is better and everlasting do you not understand
2861 is he to whom we promised a fine promise and receives it like he who has been given the enjoyment of this present life then on the day of resurrection shall be among those that are arraigned
2862 on that day he will call to them saying where are those whom you alleged to be my associates
2863 those against whom the word is realized shall say our lord those whom we led astray we led them astray even as we ourselves were astray we are quit of them to you it was not us that they worshipped
2864 it will be said to them call on your associates and they will call on them but they will not respond to them and they shall see the punishment if only they had been guided
2865 on that day he will call to them and he will say what response did you give our messengers
2866 and on that day the news will be blinded for them and they will not ask each other
2867 but as for he who repents and believes and does good deeds he will be among those who prosper
2868 your lord creates whosoever he will and he chooses the choice was not theirs the unbelievers exalted is allah above that they associate
2869 your lord knows what their chests hide and what they reveal
2870 and he is allah there is no god except he the praise is his in the former as in the latter his is the judgement to him you shall be returned
2871 say think what if allah should enshroud you in unceasing night till the day of resurrection what god other than allah shall bring you light will you not hear
2872 say what would you think if allah should make the day unceasing over you till the day of resurrection what god other than allah shall bring you the night to sleep in will you not see
2873 in his mercy he has appointed for you the night and the day so that you can rest in it and seek his bounty in order that you will be thankful
2874 upon that day he will call to them saying now where are those whom you alleged to be my associates
2875 from every nation we will bring a witness and we shall say to them produce your proof then they shall know the truth is with allah and their own fabrications will forsake them
2876  korah was one of moses nation but he was insolent to them for we had given him such treasures that their very keys were too heavy a burden for even the strong his people said to him do not exult allah does not love the boastful
2877 but seek in that which allah has given you to attain the everlasting residence do not forget your share in this world do good as allah has been good to you and do not corrupt in the land allah does not love those who corrupt
2878 but he replied what was given me is only because of the knowledge i possess did he not know that from the generations before him allah had destroyed a mightier and more numerous in multitude the sinners shall not be questioned about their sins
2879 so he went out in all his finery among his nation those who desired this life said would that we had the like of that korah has been given he has indeed a mighty fortune
2880 but those to whom knowledge had been given said alas for you better is the reward of allah for him who believes and does good works but none shall receive it except the patient
2881 we caused the earth to swallow him together with his dwelling and there was no host to help him other than allah and he was not amongst the victorious
2882 and in the morning those who had wished to be in his place the previous evening said indeed allah outspreads to whom he will among his worshipers and he restrains had he not shown us favor he could have caused the earth to swallow us indeed the unbelievers shall never prosper
2883 that is the last abode we shall assign it to those who desire neither exorbitance in the earth nor corruption the outcome is for the cautious
2884 whosoever does a good deed shall have better than it but whosoever does evil deeds they shall be recompensed for what they were doing
2885 he who has obligated the koran will bring you to an appointment say my lord knows well who comes with guidance and who is in clear error
2886 you did not hope that the book would be given to you except as mercy from your lord so do not be a supporter of the unbelievers
2887 let no one bar you from the verses of allah after they have been sent down to you but call to your lord and do not be amongst the idolaters
2888 and do not call upon another god with allah there is no god except he all things perish except his face judgement is his and to him all of you shall return
291 aliflaammeem
292 do people think that they are left alone by saying we are believers and will not be tried
293 we tried those who have gone before them allah knows those who are truthful and those who lie
294 or do the evildoers think that they will outstrip us how evil is their judgment
295 he who hopes to meet allah must know that the term of allah is coming he is the hearer the knower
296 he who strives strives for himself allah is the rich independent of the worlds
297 as for those who believe and do good works we shall acquit them of their sins and recompense them with the best for what they were doing
298 we have charged the human to be kind to his parents but if they bid you to associate with me that which you have no knowledge do not obey them to me you will return and i shall inform you of all that you have done
299 those who believe and do good works shall be admitted among the righteous
2910 there are some people who say we believe in allah yet when such is hurt in the cause of allah he makes the persecution of people as though it were the punishment of allah but then if help comes from his lord he will say we were with you does allah not know what is in the peoples chests of the worlds
2911 most certainly allah knows the believers and the hypocrites
2912 the unbelievers say to those who believe follow our path and we will carry your sins yet they cannot carry even a thing of their sins they are surely lying
2913 they shall certainly carry their loads and other loads besides their loads and on the day of resurrection they shall be questioned about what they forged
2914 indeed we sent noah to his nation and he lived amongst them for a thousand years less fifty but they belied him then the flood seized them while they were harmdoers
2915 but we saved him and all who were in the ark and made the event a sign to the worlds
2916 and remember abraham when he said to his people worship allah and fear him that would be best for you if you but knew
2917 you only worship other than allah idols and invent falsehoods those whom you worship other than allah have no power to give you provision therefore seek the provision of allah and worship him give thanks to him to him you shall return
2918 if you belie me other nations before you also belied it is only for a messenger to deliver the clear deliverance
2919 do they not see how allah originates the creation and then brings it back that is an easy matter for allah
2920 say travel in the land and see how he started the creation then allah will originate the everlasting life allah has power over all things
2921 he punishes whom he will and has mercy to whom he will to him you shall be turned
2922 you are not able to frustrate him either in the earth or heaven nor have you other than allah a guardian or helper
2923 those who disbelieve the verses of allah and the meeting with him shall despair of my mercy for them there awaits a painful punishment
2924 the only answer his nation gave was that they said kill him or burn him but allah saved him from the fire surely in this there are signs for a nation who believe
2925 he said other than allah you have taken to yourselves idols as an affection between yourselves in the present life then on the day of resurrection you shall deny one another and curse one another and your refuge will be the fire and none shall help you
2926 lot believed him and said i will migrate to my lord he is the almighty the wise
2927 and we gave him abraham isaac and jacob and appointed on his descendants the prophethood and the book we gave him his wage in this world and in the everlasting life he shall be among the righteous
2928 and lot who said to his nation you commit indecency which no other being in all the world has committed before you
2929 what do you approach men and cause a detour on the road and commit dishonor sodomy in your assembly but the only reply of his nation was then bring down the punishment of allah if what you say is true
2930 my lord he said help me against this corrupt nation
2931 and when our messengers brought abraham the glad tidings they said we are destroying the people of this village because its people are harmdoers
2932 he said lot is in it they replied we know who are in it we shall save him and his family except his wife she has become of those that shall remain behind
2933 and when our messengers came to lot he was troubled and distressed on their account but they said have no fear and do not be sad surely we will save you and your family except your wife she has become of those that shall remain behind
2934 we shall send down anger out of heaven upon the people of this city because they are debauchers
2935 indeed we left a clear sign for a nation that understands
2936 and to midian their brother shuaib he said worship allah my nation look to the last day do not make mischief in the land doing corrupt works
2937 but they belied him so the earthquake seized them and when morning came they were found fallen crouched in their dwellings dead
2938 aad and thamood it has become clear to you from their dwellings satan made their works seem fair to them and barred them from the path although they saw clearly
2939 and korah pharaoh and haman moses came to them with clear signs but they became very insolent in the earth yet they did not outstrip us
2940 each of them we seized for his sin on some we loosed a squall of pebbles and others were seized by the cry some we caused to be swallowed up by the earth and some we drowned allah would never wrong them but they wronged themselves
2941 the likeness of those who have taken guardians other than allah is as the likeness of the spider that takes to itself a house surely the spiders house is the weakest house if they but knew
2942 allah knows whatever they call upon other than him he is the almighty the wise
2943 and we strike these parables for the people but none understands except the knowledgeable
2944 allah has created the heavens and the earth with the truth surely in that there is a sign for believers
2945 recite what has been sent down to you of the book and establish the prayer prayer forbids indecency and dishonor the remembrance of allah is greater and allah knows what you do
2946 and do not dispute with the people of the book nazarenes except in the best manner except for those among them who do wrong and say to them we believe in that which was sent down to us and that which was sent down to you our god and your god is one and to him we have surrendered
2947 as such we have sent down to you the book those to whom we gave the book believe in it and so do some of these none reject our verses except the unbelievers
2948 never before did you recited any book or inscribe it with your right hand if you had done so those who follow falsehood would have doubted
2949 no rather they are clear verses in the chests of those who have been given knowledge none disbelieves our verses except the harmdoers
2950 they ask why has not a sign been sent down upon him from his lord say the signs are only with allah i am only a clear warner
2951 is it not enough for them that we have sent down to you the book that is recited to them surely in this there is a mercy and a reminder to a nation who believe
2952 say allah suffices as a witness between me and you he knows whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth those who believe in falsehood and disbelieve in allah those are they who are the losers
2953 they demand that you hasten the punishment but had it not been for the stated term the punishment would come to them it will come upon them suddenly when they are unaware
2954 they demand that you hasten on the punishment gehenna hell will encompass the unbelievers
2955 on the day the punishment shall cover them from above them and from beneath their feet he shall say taste now what you were doing
2956 o my worshipers who believe my earth is vast therefore worship me
2957 every soul shall taste death and to us you shall be returned
2958 those who believe and do good deeds we shall lodge them in the rooms of paradise underneath which rivers flow therein living for ever an excellent wage for those who labor
2959 those who are patient and put their trust in their lord
2960 how many a beast does not bear its own provision allah provides for it as he provides for you he is the hearer the knower
2961 if you ask them who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon they will say allah how perverted they are
2962 allah outspreads and restricts his provision to whomsoever he will of his worshipers allah has knowledge of all things
2963 if you were to ask them who sends down water out of the sky and thereby revives the earth after it was dead they will reply allah say praise belongs to allah no but most of them do not understand
2964 the life of this world is nothing but a diversion and play indeed the everlasting residence is the eternal life if they but knew
2965 when they embark upon ships they call to allah making their religion sincerely his but when he brings them safe to the land they associate others with him
2966 showing ingratitude for what we have given them and take their enjoyment soon they shall know
2967 do they not see how we appointed a safe sanctuary while all around them people are snatched away would they believe in falsehood and do they disbelieve in the favor of allah
2968 and who does greater evil that he who forges a lie against allah or belied the truth when it comes to him is there not a lodging in gehenna for the unbelievers
2969 those who struggle in our cause we will surely guide them to our ways and allah is with those who do good
301 aliflaammeem
302 the romans have been defeated by the persians
303 in a land close by but in a few years after their defeat they shall become the victors
304 to allah belongs the command before and after and on that day the believers will rejoice
305 in the victory of allah allah gives victory to whosoever he will and he is the mighty the merciful
306 the promise of allah allah does not fail his promise yet most people do not know
307 they know an outward part of this life but of the everlasting life they are inattentive
308 have they never thought to themselves that allah did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between except with truth and for a stated term yet most people disbelieve that they will ever meet their lord
309 what have they never journeyed in the land and seen what was the end of those before them they were stronger in might than themselves and they plowed the land and cultivated it more than they themselves have cultivated it and to them their messengers came with clear signs and allah did not wrong them but they wronged themselves
3010 evil was the end of the harmdoers because they belied the verses of allah and mocked at them
3011 allah originates creation then brings it back again then to him you shall be returned
3012 on the day when the hour comes the wrongdoers will be speechless
3013 they shall have none to intercede for them amongst their associates and they shall disbelieve in their associates
3014 on the day when the hour has come they will be divided
3015 those who believe and did good deeds shall be well pleased in a garden
3016 but those who disbelieved and belied our verses and the meeting of the everlasting life shall be arraigned for punishment
3017 therefore exalt allah when you enter the evening and in the morning
3018 his is the praise in the heavens and the earth at the setting sun and at noon
3019 he brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living he revives the earth after its death likewise you shall be brought forth
3020 and of his signs is that he created you from dust and you became humans scattered throughout the earth
3021 and of his signs is that he created for you wives from among yourselves that you might reside with them and has put kindness and mercy between you surely there are signs in this for those who think
3022 and his signs are the creation of heavens and earth and the diversity of your tongues and colors surely there are signs in this for all the worlds
3023 and of his signs is that you sleep at night and day and seek his bounty surely there are signs in this for those who hear
3024 and of his signs is that he shows you the lightning for fear and hope he sends down water from the sky and with it he revives the earth after its death surely in this there are signs for a nation that understand
3025 and of his signs is that the heaven and earth stand firm at his command and when he calls you once out of the earth you shall come forth
3026 to him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and the earth all are obedient to his will
3027 it is he who originates the creation and then brings it back again that is easier for him for him is the highest example in the heavens and earth he is the almighty the wise
3028 he sets for you an example drawn from yourselves do you have from among those whom your right hand possesses associates in what we have given you who share it equally with you do you fear them as you fear one another so we made plain our signs to a nation of understanding
3029 no the wrongdoers follow their own desires without knowledge and who can guide those whom allah has led astray there shall be none to help them
3030 therefore set your face to the religion purely the upright creation upon which he originated people there is no changing of the creation of allah this is the valuable religion although most people do not know
3031 turning to him and fear him establish the prayer and do not be of the idolaters
3032 those who have divided their religion and become sects each rejoicing in what they have
3033 when affliction befalls mankind they turn to him calling their lord in prayer but when he lets them taste his mercy some of them assign associates to their lord
3034 disbelieving in what we have given them enjoy but you shall soon know
3035 or have we sent down to them an authority that speaks of that they associate with him
3036 when we give people a taste of mercy they rejoice in it but when evil befalls them through the forwarding of their own hands they become despondent
3037 do they not see that allah outspreads and restricts his provision to whom he will surely there are signs in this for those who believe
3038 and give to the kinsman his due and to the needy and to the destitute traveler that is best for those who desire the face of allah such will surely prosper
3039 that which you give in usury so that it increases in other peoples wealth will not increase with allah but the charity you give desiring the face of allah to those they shall be recompensed many times over
3040 it is allah who has created you and given you your provision he will cause you to die and will then revive you can any of your associates do any of that exalted is he above what they associate
3041 corruption has appeared on land and sea with what the hands of the people earned therefore they taste some of what they did in order that they return
3042 say journey in the land and see what was the end of those who were before you most of them were idolaters
3043 therefore in purity set your face to the religion before there comes from allah a day that cannot be turned back on that day mankind will be separated
3044 those who disbelieve will be charged for their disbelief while the righteous are making provision for themselves
3045 so that he will recompense those who believe and do righteous deeds from his bounty he does not love the unbelievers
3046 and of his signs is that he looses the winds as bearers of glad tidings so that he lets you taste his mercy and that the ships may sail at his command in order that you can seek his bounty and be thankful
3047 before you we sent other messengers to their people and they came with clear signs we took revenge upon the sinners and it was an incumbent duty upon us to give victory to the believers
3048 it is allah who looses the winds that stir the clouds he spreads them as he will in heaven and disperses them so that you can see the rain falling from their midst when he smites with it whom he will of his worshipers they rejoice
3049 though before its coming they had despaired
3050 look then at the marks of mercy of allah how he revives the earth after its death he is the reviver of the dead he has power over all things
3051 yet if we sent a wind so they see it yellow indeed after that they would still be unbelievers
3052 you cannot make the dead hear you nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they retreat turning about
3053 you cannot guide the blind out of their error nor shall you make any to hear except those who believe in our verses and are submissive
3054 allah creates you weak after weakness he gives you strength and after strength weakness and gray hairs he creates whatever he will he is the knower the capable
3055 upon the day when the hour has come the harmdoers will swear that they had stayed no more than an hour as such they are deceived
3056 but those to whom knowledge and belief have been given will say you have stayed in the book of allah the protected tablets till the day of resurrection this is the day of resurrection yet you did not know
3057 on that day excuses shall not benefit the harmdoers nor shall they be asked to make amends
3058 in this koran we have set forth for mankind all manner of examples yet if you bring to them a sign the unbelievers will surely say you are but falsifiers
3059 as such allah seals the hearts of those who do not know
3060 therefore have patience the promise of allah is true do not let those who are uncertain make you unsteady
311 aliflaammeem
312 those are the verses of the wise book
313 a guidance and a mercy to those who do good
314 who establish the prayer pay the obligatory charity and firmly believe in the everlasting life
315 those are guided by their lord and will surely prosper
316 there are some people who would purchase distracting talk to lead astray from the path of allah without knowledge and take it in mockery for those is a humiliating punishment
317 when our verses are recited to him he turns his back in pride as though he never heard them and in his ears was heaviness give glad tidings to him of a painful punishment
318 but for those who believe and do good works are gardens of bliss
319 where they shall live for ever the promise of allah is the truth he is the almighty the wise
3110 he created the heavens without pillars that you see and cast on the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with you upon it he dispersed all manner of crawling thing and he sent down water from the sky with which he caused to grow in it every generous kind
3111 such is the creation of allah now show me what other than him created no the harmdoers are in clear error
3112 we gave wisdom to lokman saying give thanks to allah he who gives thanks thanks only for himself but whosoever is ungrateful surely allah is the rich the praised
3113 and when lokman said to his son in warning my son associate none with allah to associate others with allah is a tremendous wrong
3114 and we charged the human concerning his parents for his mother bore him in weakness upon weakness and his weaning was in two years be thankful to me and to your parents to me is the arrival
3115 but if they strive with you to make you associate with me that of which you have no knowledge do not obey them and accompany them in this life with kindness and follow the path of he who turned to me to me you shall return and i will inform you of all that you have done
3116 lokman said my son if it should be but the weight of one grain of mustardseed and though it be on a rock or in the heavens or in the earth allah shall bring it surely allah is the subtle aware
3117 my son establish the prayer order with honor but forbid dishonor and bear patiently with whatever may fall upon you indeed that is true constancy
3118 do not turn your cheek in scorn away from people nor walk proudly on the earth allah does not love the proud and the boastful
3119 walk modestly and lower your voice the most hideous of voices is the braying of the donkey
3120 do you not see how allah has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and the earth and lavished on you his visible and unseen favors yet some people would argue about allah without knowledge or guidance or an illuminating book
3121 when it is said to them follow what allah has sent down they reply no rather we will follow that which we found our fathers upon what even though satan is inviting them to the punishment of the fire
3122 he who surrenders himself to allah and is a good doer has grasped the firmest handle to allah the issue of affairs return
3123 as for those who disbelieve do not let their disbelief grieve you to us they shall return and we will tell to them what they did allah has knowledge of what is innermost in their chests
3124 we give to them a little enjoyment for awhile and then will compel them to a tremendous punishment
3125 if you ask them who has created the heavens and the earth they will reply allah say praise belongs to allah but most of them do not have knowledge
3126 to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth he is the rich the praised
3127 if all the trees in the earth were pens and the sea with seven more seas to replenish it with ink the words of allah would never end allah is the almighty the wise
3128 your creation and your resurrection are but as a single soul allah is the hearer the seer
3129 do you not see how allah causes the night to enter into the day and the day enter into the night and has subjected the sun and the moon each running to a named term allah is aware of what you do
3130 for allah is the truth while that which they call upon other than him is false for that allah is the most high the great
3131 do you not see how the ships run upon the sea by the favor of allah so that he may show you his signs surely there are signs in this for every steadfast thankful person
3132 when the waves like shadows envelop them they call to allah making their religion sincerely his but no sooner does he bring them safely to land then some of them are halfhearted none denies our verses except the ungrateful traitor
3133 people fear your lord and fear the day when no father shall ransom a thing for his child nor a child for his father the promise of allah is surely true so do not let the life of this present world delude you nor let the deluder satan delude you concerning allah
3134 allah he alone has knowledge of the hour he sends down the rain and he knows what is in the wombs no soul knows what he will earn tomorrow and no soul knows in what land it will die surely allah is the knower the aware
321 aliflaammeem
322 the sending down of the book in which there is no doubt that is from the lord of the worlds
323 or do they say he has forged it himself say no it is the truth from your lord so that you can warn a nation to whom none has warned before you in order that they are guided
324 it was allah who in six days created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and then willed to the throne you have no guardian nor intercessor other than him will you not remember
325 he directs the affair from heaven to earth then it will ascend to him in one day a day whose value is a thousand years by your reckoning
326 he is the knower of the unseen and the visible the almighty the most merciful
327 who perfected everything he created he originated the creation of the human from clay
328 then he made his offspring from a clot of weak water semen
329 then he created him and caused the angel to breathe into him his created spirit he gave you eyes and ears and hearts yet little do you thank
3210 they say what when we have been destroyed in the earth shall we indeed be in a new creation indeed they disbelieve that they will meet their lord
3211 say the angel of death who has been given charge of you will gather you then to your lord you shall be returned
3212 would that you could see the wrongdoers when they lower their heads before their lord they will say our lord we have now seen and heard send us back and we will do righteous deeds we are certain
3213 had we willed we would have guided every soul but my word shall be realized i will fill gehenna hell with jinn and people all together
3214 we shall say to them now taste for you forgot the encounter of this day we have forgotten you taste our eternal punishment for that which you were doing
3215 only those who believe in our verses when reminded of them prostrate themselves and exalt with the praise of their lord in humility
3216 whose sides forsake their couches as they supplicate to their lord in fear and hope who give in charity of that which we have given them
3217 no soul knows what pleases the eye is in store for them as a recompense for what they used to do
3218 can he then who is a believer be compared to he who is wicked they are not equal
3219 as for those who believe and do good works there are for them the gardens of refuge in hospitality for that which they have done
3220 but those who do evil their refuge is the fire as often as they desire to come out of it they shall be driven back and it will be said to them taste the punishment of the fire which you have belied
3221 but we will let them taste the nearest punishment in this life before the greater punishment so that they may return to faith
3222 and who is more wicked than he who when reminded of the verses of his lord turns away from them we take revenge on the sinners
3223 we have given the book to moses so prophet muhammad do not be in doubt concerning the meeting with him prophet moses and made it a guidance to the children of israel
3224 when they were patient we made from them leaders guiding with our command and they were certain of our verses
3225 on the day of resurrection your lord will distinguish between them that on which they varied
3226 is it not a guidance to them how many generations we destroyed before them in whose dwelling places they walk surely in this there are signs will they not then hear
3227 do they not see how we drive the water to the parched lands and bring forth therefrom crops from which their cattle and themselves eat will they not see
3228 they also ask when will this opening come if what you say is true
3229 say on the day of opening the faith of the unbelievers will not benefit them nor shall they be respited
3230 therefore turn away from them and wait they are waiting
331 o prophet fear allah and do not obey the unbelievers and the hypocrites allah is the knower the wise
332 follow what is revealed to you from your lord for allah is aware of what they do
333 put your trust in allah allah suffices as a guardian
334 allah has never made any man with two hearts inside him nor has he made your wives when you divorce saying be as my mothers back your mothers neither has he made your fostered sons as your own sons these are your own sayings words which you utter with your mouths but allah speaks the truth and guides to the path
335 name them after their fathers that is more just with allah if you do not know their fathers regard them as your brothers in the religion or those under your sponsorship there is no fault in you if you make mistakes but only in what your hearts intended allah is forgiving and the most merciful
336 the prophet has a greater right on the believers than their own selves his wives are their mothers kinsmen are closer to one another in the book of allah than to other believers and the emigrants although you should act honorably towards those you sponsor that is written in the book
337 we took from the prophets their covenant and from you prophet muhammad from noah and abraham from moses and jesus the son of mary we took a solemn covenant from them
338 so that allah might question the truthful about their truthfulness but for the unbelievers he has prepared a painful punishment
339 believers remember the favor of allah to you when there came against you hosts armies we unleashed against them a wind and hosts angels you could not see allah sees the things you do
3310 they came on you from above and from below and when your eyes swerved and your hearts leapt to your throats and you thought thoughts about allah
3311 there the believers were tried they were shaken a severe quake
3312 the hypocrites and those in whose hearts there is a disease said allah and his messenger promised nothing but delusion
3313 and when a party of them said people of yathrib madinah there is no place for you here therefore return and a party of them asked leave of theprophet saying our houses are exposed whereas they were not they only wished to flee
3314 and if an entrance had been forced against them from its quarters and then they had been asked to incite they would have done so and remained in it the city but a little time
3315 yet before that they made a covenant with allah never to turn their backs and covenants with allah shall be questioned
3316 say flight will not avail you if you flee from death or slaughter you would enjoy this world only for a little time
3317 say who can defend you from allah if he desires harm for you or if he desires mercy for you they shall find for themselves none other than allah to protect or help them
3318 allah knows those of you who hinder and those who say to their brothers come to us and they do not come to the battle but a little
3319 being mean towards you when fear comes to them you see them looking at you their eyes rolling as though they were on the point of death but once the fear departs they assail you with their sharp tongues being greedy to possess good things those have never believed allah has annulled their deeds that is easy for allah
3320 they think the confederates have not departed indeed if the confederates should come again they would sooner be in the desert among the bedouins asking news of you if they were among you they would fight but a little
3321 in the messenger of allah you have a fine example for he who hopes for allah and the last day and remembers allah abundantly
3322 when the believers saw the confederates they said this is what allah and his messenger have promised us surely allah and his messenger have spoken in truth and this did not increase them except in belief and submission
3323 among the believers there are men who have been true to their covenant with allah some have fulfilled their vow dying and others await unyielding tochange
3324 so that allah will recompense the truthful for their truthfulness and punish the hypocrites if he will or turn again to them surely allah is the forgiver and the most merciful
3325 allah sent back the unbelievers in their rage and they gained no good allah spared the believers from fighting surely allah is the strong the mighty
3326 he brought down from their fortresses those who had supported them from among the people of the jewish book and cast terror into their hearts so that some you killed and others you took captive
3327 he made you inheritors of their land their houses and their possessions and another land on which you had never set foot before truly allah is powerful over everything
3328 o prophet say to your wives if you seek this life and its finery come i will release you with a fine release
3329 but if you seek allah and his messenger and the everlasting residence know that allah has prepared for those of you who do good works a mighty wage
3330 o wives of the prophet whosoever among you commit a flagrant indecency for her the punishment shall be doubled that is easy for allah
3331 but she who obeys allah and his messenger and does good works shall be doubly recompensed for her we have made a generous provision
3332 o wives of the prophet you are not like other women if you fear allah do not be to complaisant in your speech lest he in whose heart there is a sickness may desire of his mother but speak honorable words
3333 stay in your homes and do not display your finery as pagan women used to do in the olden days of ignorance establish your prayers pay the obligatory charity and obey allah and his messenger o family of the house allah only wishes to distance fault from you and to cleanse you and to purify you abundantly
3334 and remember that which is recited in your houses of the verses of allah and the wisdom allah is the subtle the knower
3335 for men and women who have surrendered believing men and women obedient men and women truthful men and women patient men and women humble men and women men and women who give charity men and women who fast men and women who guard their privates men and women who remember allah in abundance for them allah has prepared forgiveness and a mighty wage
3336 it is not for any believer man or woman to have the choice in the affair when a matter is decreed by allah and his prophet whosoever disobeys allah and his messenger strays into clear error
3337 and when you said to he whom allah had favored and yourself have favored keep your wife and fear allah and you sought to hide in yourself what allah was to reveal fearing people although allah has a better right for you to fear him and when zayd had accomplished what he would of her divorce we gave her to you prophet muhammad in marriage so that there is no fault in believers concerning marriage to the former spouse of their foster children if they divorced them the decree of allah must be done
3338 no fault shall be attached to the prophet for doing what allah has obligated for him such was the way of allah with those who passed away before the decree of allah is a decree determined
3339 who were delivering the messages of allah fearing him and fearing none except allah allah suffices as a reckoner
3340 muhammad is not the father of any of your men he is the messenger of allah and the seal of the prophets allah has knowledge of all things
3341 believers remember allah frequently
3342 exalt him at dawn and in the evening
3343 it is he who has mercy on you and his angels to bring you out from the darkness into light he is the most merciful to the believers
3344 on the day they meet him their greeting shall be peace a generous recompense he has prepared for them
3345 o prophet we have sent you as a witness a bearer of glad tidings and to bear warning
3346 a caller to allah by his permission and as a light shedding lamp
3347 give to the believers the glad tidings that with allah there is for them a great bounty
3348 do not obey the unbelievers and the hypocrites pay no attention to their hurt put your trust in allah allah suffices as a guardian
3349 believers if you marry believing women and divorce them before the marriage is consummated you have no period to count against them provide for them and release them kindly
3350 o prophet we have made lawful to you the wives to whom you have given dowries and those whom your right hand possesses of whatever spoils of war that allah has given you and the daughters of your paternal uncles and paternal aunts and of your paternal and maternal aunts who migrated with you and any believing woman who gives herself to the prophet if the prophet wishes to take her in marriage this is only for you and not any other believer we know the duties we have imposed on them concerning their wives and those whom their right hand possesses so that there should be no fault in you allah is the forgiving and merciful
3351 you may defer any of them your wives if you please and invite any of them if you please if you seek any you have put aside there is no fault in you so that it is likelier they will be comforted and not sorrow and every one of them will be pleased and all are pleased with what you give them allah knows what is in your hearts allah is the knower the clement
3352 it shall be unlawful for you to take more wives or to exchange your present wives for other women though their beauty pleases you except those whom your right hand possesses allah is watchful over everything
3353 believers do not enter the houses of the prophet for a meal without waiting for the proper time unless you are given permission but if you are invited enter and when you have eaten disperse not desiring conversation for that is hurtful to the prophet and he would be shy before you but of the truth allah is not shy and when you ask his wives for anything speak to them from behind a curtain that is cleaner for your hearts and theirs you must not hurt the messenger of allah nor shall you ever wed his wives after him surely this would be a monstrous thing with allah
3354 whether you reveal a thing or conceal it allah has knowledge of all things
3355 it shall be no offense for them to be seen unveiled by their fathers their sons their brothers their brothers sons their sisters sons their women and those whom their right hands possess and fear allah for allah is witness of everything
3356 allah and his angels praise and venerate the prophet believers praise and venerate him and pronounce peace upon him in abundance
3357 those who try to hurt allah and his messenger shall be cursed by allah in this present life and in the everlasting life and he has prepared for them a humbling punishment
3358 those who hurt believing men and believing women undeservedly shall bear the guilt of slander and a major sin
3359 o prophet tell your wives your daughters and the believing women to draw their veils close to them so it is likelier they will be known and not hurt allah is the forgiver the most merciful
3360 if the hypocrites and those who have a disease in their hearts and those who make a commotion in the city do not desist we will surely urge you against them then they will be your neighbors for only a little while
3361 cursed wherever they are found they will be seized and put to death
3362 such has been the way of allah with those who have passed before them and you shall find no change in the ways of allah
3363 the people will ask you about the hour say the knowledge of it is with allah alone what makes you to know that the hour is near
3364 allah has cursed the unbelievers and prepared for them a blaze
3365 living there for ever they shall neither find a guardian nor a helper
3366 on that day when their faces are turned about in the fire they shall say would that we had obeyed allah and obeyed the messenger
3367 and they shall say our lord we obeyed our masters and our eminent ones but they misled us from the way
3368 our lord let their punishment be doubled and curse them with a mighty curse
3369 believers do not be like those who hurt moses allah cleared him of what they said his face is honorable with allah
3370 o you who believe fear allah and say sound statements
3371 and he will mend your deeds for you and forgive your sins whosoever obeys allah and his messenger shall win a great victory
3372 we offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains but they refused to bear it and were afraid of it and the human carried it surely he is a harmdoer and ignorant
3373 allah punishes the hypocrites men and women alike and the idolaters both men and women alike and allah turns to the believers men and women alike allah is the forgiver the most merciful
341 praise is for allah to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and the praise belongs to him in the everlasting life he is the wise the knower
342 he knows all that penetrates the earth and all that comes forth from it all that comes down from heaven and all that ascends to it he is the most merciful the forgiver
343 the unbelievers say the hour will never come to us say by my lord yes it is surely coming to you by him who knows the unseen not even the weight of an atom in heavens and earth escapes him neither is there anything smaller than that nor greater except that it is in a clear book
344 in order that he recompenses those who believe and do good works theirs shall be forgiveness and a generous provision
345 but those who labor against our verses thinking they are frustrating our messengers theirs shall be the painful punishment of anger
346 those to whom the knowledge has been given can see that what has been sent down to you from your lord is the truth guiding to the path of the almighty the praised
347 the unbelievers say shall we direct you to a man who will tell you that when you have been utterly torn into pieces you will be raised in a new creation
348 what has he forged a lie about allah or is he mad no those who do not believe in the everlasting life are in the punishment and in far error
349 have they not seen what is before them and behind them in heaven and earth if we willed we would make the earth swallow them up or we would let lumps from heaven fall down on them surely there is a sign in this for every penitent worshiper
3410 we gave david bounty from us o mountains and birds echo the praise of allah with him and we softened iron for him
3411 saying make large coats of mail and measure their links well do good deeds for surely i see the things you do
3412 to solomon the morning course of the wind was a months journey and its evening course was also a months journey we caused copper to be as a molten spring for him and the jinn some served him by the permission of his lord but as for those amongst them that swerved away from our command we shall let them taste the punishment of the blaze the fire
3413 they made for him whatever he wanted arches statues bowls as basins and fixed cauldrons we said give thanks house of david and work yet only a few of my worshipers are thankful
3414 and when we decreed solomons death they had no indication that he was dead until they saw a termite a crawler of the earth eating away his staff and when he fell down the jinn realized that had they known the unseen they would not have continued in their humiliating punishment
3415 for sheba there was indeed a sign in their dwelling place there were two gardens on the right and left side we said eat of your lords provisions and give thanks to him a good land and a lord who is the forgiving
3416 but they turned away so we sent against them the flood at the city of arim and exchanged their gardens with two others bearing bitter fruit andtamarisks and here and there a few lotus trees
3417 as such we recompensed them for their disbelief do we recompense any except the unbelievers
3418 between them and the villages which we had blessed we placed easily visible villages and we spaced the journey between them exactly we saidtravel through them by day and night in safety
3419 but they said lord make the stages between our journeys longer so they wronged themselves so we made them news and we tore them utterly into pieces surely there are signs in this for every one who is patient thankful
3420 iblis made his guess true to them and all except for a party of believers followed him
3421 yet he had no authority over them except that we would know who believed in the everlasting life from he who doubted your lord is the watcher over all things
3422 say call on those whom you assert other than allah they do not possess as much as the weight of an atom in the heavens or earth nor do they have a partnership in either neither does he have supporters among them
3423 intercession with him will not help except for him to whom he gives permission when terror is lifted from their hearts they shall say what did your lord say the truth they shall answer he is the most high the great
3424 say who provides for you from the heavens and earth say allah surely either we or you are rightly guided or in clear error
3425 say you will not to be questioned about our sins neither will we be questioned for your actions
3426 say our lord will bring us all together then with truth he will rightly judge between us he is the opener the knower
3427 say show me those whom you joined with him as associates no indeed rather he is allah the almighty the wise
3428 we did not send you prophet muhammad for all mankind except to bring them glad tidings and to warn but most people do not know
3429 they ask when if what you say is true will this promise come
3430 say you are promised a day you can neither hold it back nor can you hasten it by a single hour
3431 the unbelievers say we will not believe in this koran nor in the books that were before it if you could only see the harmdoers when they are brought before their lord they will argue against each other those who had been abased will say to those who were proud but for you we would have been believers
3432 then those who were proud will say to those who were abased was it we who barred you from the guidance after it had come to you no you yourselves were sinners
3433 those that were abased will say to those who were proud rather it was scheming night and day when you ordered us to disbelieve in allah and set up equals to him and they will regret in secret when they see the punishment and we put iron fetters on the necks of the unbelievers shall they be recompensed except for what they were doing
3434 we never sent a warner to a village except that those who lived in luxury said we disbelieve in the message you have been sent with
3435 and they said we have been given an abundance of wealth and children we shall never be punished
3436 say my lord outspreads and withholds his provision to whomsoever he will but most people do not know
3437 it is neither your riches nor your children that shall bring you close in nearness to us except he who believes and does good work for those their awaits a double recompense for their deeds they shall live in safety in their lofty chambers
3438 but those who labor to negate our verses shall be arraigned in to the punishment
3439 say my lord outspreads and withholds his provision to whomsoever he will of his worshipers whatsoever you expend he will replace it he is the best of providers
3440 on the day when he gathers them all together he will say to the angels was it you that these worshipped
3441 exaltations to you they will answer you are our guardian other than them no rather they worshipped the jinn and it was them which most believed
3442 therefore today none of you shall have the power to either benefit or harm one another to the evildoers we shall say taste the punishment of the fire which you belied
3443 when our clear verses are recited to them they say this is nothing but a man whose wish is to prevent you from that which your fathers used to worship and they say this is nothing but a forged lie and those who disbelieve say of the truth when it reaches them this is nothing but clear sorcery
3444 yet we have not given them any books to study nor before you have we sent them a warner
3445 those who have gone before them belied yet they did not reach a tenth of what we gave them yet they belied my messengers and how was my rejection their destruction
3446 say i give you only one admonition that you stand before allah either two by two or one by one and reflect there is no madness is in your companion he prophet muhammad is only a warner to you before a terrible punishment
3447 say i ask no wage of you that shall be yours my wage is only upon allah and he is witness over everything
3448 say my lord hurls the truth the knower of the unseen
3449 say truth has come falsehood has vanished and shall return no more
3450 say if i go astray then i go astray only against myself if i am guided it is because of that which my lord has revealed to me he is the hearer and thenear
3451 if you could only see when they the unbelievers are seized with terror and there is no escape they shall be seized from a nearby place
3452 and say we believe in it but how can they reach from a place that is distant
3453 since they disbelieved in it before guessing at the unseen from a distant place
3454 and a barrier is set between them and that which they desire as it was done before with their like they were in suspicious doubt
351 praise belongs for allah the originator of the heavens and earth who appointed the angels to be messengers with wings two three and four he increases the creation as he wills allah has power over all things
352 whatever mercy allah opens to people none can withhold and whatever he withholds none can release after him he is the almighty the wise
353 people remember the blessings of allah to you except for allah is there any other creator who provides for you out of heaven and earth there is no god except he where then do you turn
354 if they belie you other messengers have been belied before you to allah all matters are returned
355 people the promise of allah is true so do not let this present life delude you and do not let the deluder satan delude you about allah
356 satan is indeed your enemy therefore take him for an enemy he calls his party so that they will become the companions of the blaze
357 for the unbelievers awaits a terrible punishment but for those who believe and do good deeds is forgiveness and a great recompense
358 what then of he whose evil deeds have been decorated fair to him and thinks them to be good allah leads astray whomsoever he will and whomsoever he will he guides do not let your soul be wasted in regrets for them allah has knowledge of all they do
359 allah is he who sends the winds that stir up the clouds then we drive them on to a dead land and revive the earth after its death such is the raising up
3510 he who wants might the might belongs to allah altogether to him ascend good words and the righteous deed he raises but those who devise evil deeds theirs shall be a terrible punishment and their plotting shall be annulled
3511 allah created you from dust then from a sperm drop then he made you pairs no female conceives or is delivered except by his knowledge he whose life is long whatsoever is increased or decreased of his age is in a clear book surely that is easy for allah
3512 the two seas are not alike one is fresh sweet and pleasant to taste while the other is salt and bitter yet from each you eat fresh flesh and bring forth out of it ornaments for you to wear and you see the ships plow their course through it so that you may seek his bounty and in order that you give thanks
3513 he causes the night to enter into the day and the day into the night he has subjected the sun and the moon each running for a named term such is allah your lord to him belongs the kingdom and those whom you call upon other than him do not possess even as much as the membrane of a datestone
3514 if you supplicate to them they cannot hear your supplication and if they heard they cannot answer you on the day of resurrection they will disown your associating none can tell you like he who is the aware
3515 people it is you who are in need of allah he is the rich the praised
3516 he can put you away if he will and bring a new creation
3517 this is not a great matter for allah
3518 no laden soul shall bear anothers load if one is heavyburdened and calls for his load to be carried nothing of it will be carried not even if he is a close relative you warn only those who fear their lord in the unseen and establish the prayer he who purifies himself purifies himself for the good of his own soul to allah is the arrival
3519 the blind and the seeing are not equal
3520 nor are darkness and light
3521 the shade and the hot wind are not equal
3522 nor are the living and the dead equal allah makes to hear whosoever he will but you cannot make those who are in their graves hear
3523 you prophet muhammad are but a warner
3524 we have sent you with the truth a bearer of glad tidings and warning for there is no nation that has not had a warner pass away in it
3525 if they belie you those before them also belied their messengers came to them with clear signs the psalms and the illuminating book
3526 then i seized those who disbelieved and how was my rejection
3527 did you not see how allah sends down water from the sky and with it brings forth different colored fruits in the mountains there are paths of various colors of white and red and jetblack
3528 people too and beasts and cattle have their different colors but it is only those amongst his worshippers that fear allah who have knowledge indeed allah is the almighty and the forgiving
3529 indeed those who recite the book of allah and establish their prayers and spend in secret and in public of that which we have provided them look for a trade that does not come to nothing
3530 so that he may pay them in full their wages and enrich them from his bounty surely he is the forgiver and the thanker
3531 that which we have revealed to you of the book is the truth and it confirms what was before it allah is aware and sees his worshipers
3532 then we gave the book as an inheritance to those of our worshipers whom we chose among them is he who was harmful to himself and some who minimize and some who by the permission of allah race in charity this is the greatest virtue
3533 they shall enter the gardens of eden where they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and with pearls and there their robes shall be of silk
3534 they shall say praise belongs to allah who has removed all sorrow from us indeed our lord is the forgiver the thanker
3535 through his bounty he has made us to live in the abode of everlasting life where neither weariness nor fatigue shall touch us
3536 as for the unbelievers theirs is the fire of gehenna they shall neither be done away with nor die and its punishment shall never be lightened for them as such shall we recompense every unbeliever
3537 there they will cry out our lord bring us out and we will do good other than what we have done what did we not make your lives long enough to remember for whosoever would remember a warner came to you so taste now none shall help the harmdoers
3538 allah knows the unseen in the heavens and earth he knows that which is in the innermost of the chests
3539 it is he who made you caliphs in the earth he who disbelieves his disbelief shall be charged against him the unbelievers disbelief does nothing for them except increase them in hate with allah their disbelief increases the unbelievers only in loss
3540 say have you considered your associates who you call upon other than allah show me what they have created in the earth or have they a partnership in the heavens or have we given them a book so that they have proof of it no the harmdoers promise each other nothing else but delusion
3541 it is allah who holds the heavens and the earth lest they vanish should they vanish none would hold them after him he is the clement the forgiving
3542 they solemnly swore by allah that if a warner came to them they would be more rightly guided than any other of the nations yet when a warner came to them it only increased their aversion
3543 behaving arrogantly in the land and devising evil but evil devising coils only those who do it do they look except for the ways of former nations you shall never find any change in the way of allah
3544 what have they not journeyed through the land and seen the end of those who went before them they were stronger and mightier than themselves allah there is nothing in heavens or earth that can frustrate him he is the knower the able
3545 if allah should take people to task for what they have earned he would not leave one creature that crawls upon the face of the earth but he is deferring them to a named time and when their time comes indeed allah is the seer of his worshipers
361 yaseen
362 by the wise koran
363 you prophet muhammad are truly among the messengers sent
364 upon a straight path
365 the sending down of the mighty the most merciful
366 so that you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned and so were heedless
367 the phrase has become obligatory upon most of them yet they do not believe
368 we have bound their necks with fetters up to their chin so that their heads are raised and cannot be lowered
369 we have set a barrier before them and a barrier behind them and we have covered them so that they do not see
3610 it is the same whether you have warned them or you have not warned them they do not believe
3611 you only warn he who follows the remembrance and fears the merciful in the unseen give to him glad tidings of forgiveness and a generous wage
3612 surely it is we who revive the dead and write down what they have forwarded and what they have left behind we have counted everything in a clear book
3613 give to them a parable to the people of the village there came messengers
3614 we sent to them two but they belied them so we reinforced them with a third they said we have surely been sent as messengers to you
3615 but they said you are only humans like ourselves the merciful has not sent down anything your speech is but lies
3616 they said our lord knows that we are messengers to you
3617 and it is only for us to deliver a clear message
3618 they answered we predict evil of you if you do not desist we will stone you and a painful punishment from us will befall you
3619 they said your prediction is with you if you are reminded surely you are but a wayward nation
3620 then a man came running from the furthest part of the village my nation he said follow the messengers
3621 follow those who ask no wage of you and are rightly guided
3622 why should i not worship him who has originated me and to whom you shall all be returned
3623 what shall i take other than him gods whose intercession if the merciful desires to afflict me cannot help me at all and they will never save me
3624 surely i should then be in clear error
3625 i believe in your lord so hear me
3626 it was said to him enter paradise and he said would that my people knew
3627 that my lord has forgiven me and caused me to be amongst the receivers of generosity
3628 and we did not send down to his nation after him any army from heaven neither would we send any down
3629 it was only one shout and they were silent still
3630 woe for those unbelieving worshipers they mocked every messenger that came to them
3631 have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them they shall never return to them
3632 all shall be arraigned before us
3633 the dead land is a sign for them we revive it and from it produce grain from which they eat
3634 and there we made gardens of palms and vines and in it we caused fountains to gush forth
3635 so that they might eat of its fruit and the labor of their hands will they not give thanks
3636 exaltations to him who created pairs of all the things the earth produces and of themselves and that of which they have no knowledge
3637 a sign for them is the night from it we withdraw the day and they are in darkness
3638 the sun runs to its fixed restingplace that is the decree of the almighty the knower
3639 and the moon we have determined it in phases till it returns like an old palmbranch
3640 the sun shall not outstrip the moon nor shall the night outstrip the day each is floating in an orbit
3641 and a sign for them is that we carried their offspring in the laden ark of noah
3642 and we have created for them the like of it in which they board
3643 we drown them if we will then they have none to cry to nor can they be saved
3644 except through our mercy and as enjoyment for awhile
3645 when it is said to them have fear of that which is before you and behind you in order that you find mercy
3646 yet there never comes to them any sign of their lords signs but they turn away from it
3647 and when it is said to them spend of that which allah has given you the unbelievers say to the believers are we to feed those whom allah can feed if he chooses surely you are only in clear error
3648 they also say when will this promise be if what you say is true
3649 they await but one shout which will seize them while they dispute
3650 then they will be unable to make a will nor shall they return to their kinsmen
3651 and the horn is blown and from the graves they rush forth to their lord
3652 woe for us they will say who has roused us from our sleepingplace this is what the merciful promised the messengers have spoken the truth
3653 and it is but one shout and they are all arraigned before us
3654 today no soul shall be wronged a thing you shall not be recompensed except according to your deeds
3655 indeed the companions of the garden are this day busy in their rejoicing
3656 together with their spouses they shall recline on couches in the shade
3657 they shall have fruits and all that they call for
3658 peace a saying from the most merciful lord
3659 and he will say distance yourselves o sinners this day
3660 children of adam did i not make a covenant with you that you should not worship satan he is surely a clear enemy to you
3661 and that you worship me surely that is the straight path
3662 yet he has led many a host of you astray did you not understand
3663 this then is gehenna hell that which you were promised
3664 roast well therein this day for you were unbelievers
3665 this day we set a seal on their mouths and their hands speak to us and their feet will testify to their earnings
3666 had it been our will we would have obliterated their sight so that they raced to the path but how would they see
3667 had it been our will we would have transmuted them into monkeys pigs and stones where they were so that they could neither go forward nor yet return
3668 to whoever we give a long life we make him stoop do they not understand
3669 we have not taught him prophet muhammad poetry nor does it become him this is only a remembrance and a clear holy reading koran
3670 that he may warn the living and so that judgement may be passed against the unbelievers
3671 have they not seen how we have created for them the cattle they master with our hands
3672 we have subdued these to them and some of them they ride and some of them they eat
3673 they also have other uses in them and drinks what will they not give thanks
3674 and yet they have taken gods other than allah so that they might helped
3675 they cannot help them for them the socalled army are brought with them to hell
3676 so do not let their sayings grieve you surely we have knowledge of what they hide and all that they reveal
3677 has the human not seen how we created him from a drop of sperm yet he is a clear opponent
3678 and he has struck for us a parable and forgotten his own creation he asks who will quicken the bones after they have decayed
3679 say he will quicken them who originated them the first time he has knowledge of every creation
3680 who has made fire for you from the green tree with which you kindle
3681 is he who created the heavens and the earth unable to create their like yes indeed he is the creator the knower
3682 when he wills a thing his command is to say to it be and it is
3683 exaltations to him in whose hand is the kingdom of all things and to him you will be returned
371 by the aligners angels aligning
372 and the drivers driving
373 and those who recite the remembrance
374 surely your god is one
375 the lord of the heavens and the earth and of all that is between them the lord of the easts
376 we have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the planets
377 a protection against every rebel satan
378 so they cannot listen to the high assembly for they are pelted from every side
379 they are rejected and theirs is an everlasting punishment
3710 except such as snatches a fragment and he is pursued by a piercing flame
3711 so ask them are they stronger in constitution or those whom we have created we have created them of sticky clay
3712 no you marvel while they scoff
3713 when they are reminded they do not remember
3714 when they are shown a sign they scoff at it
3715 and say this is nothing but clear sorcery
3716 what when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we be resurrected
3717 what and our forefathers the ancients
3718 say yes but worthless
3719 it will be but one shout then see they are watching
3720 and they will say woe for us this is the day of recompense
3721 this is the day of decision which you belied
3722 gather together the evildoers their wives and that they were worshipping
3723 other than allah and guide them to the path of hell
3724 and halt them so that they may be questioned
3725 why do you not help one another
3726 no today they will resign themselves in submission
3727 and approach each other with questions
3728 saying you used to come to us from the right hand
3729 but they reply rather you were not believers
3730 we had no authority over you but you were an insolent nation
3731 the statement of our lord is realized against us and we are tasting it
3732 we perverted you indeed we were perverts
3733 therefore on that day they will all share our punishment
3734 as such we shall deal with the evildoers
3735 for when it was said to them there is no god except allah they were always proud
3736 and said are we to renounce our gods for the sake of a mad poet
3737 no indeed he has brought the truth and confirmed the messengers
3738 you shall certainly taste the painful punishment
3739 but you shall not be recompensed except for what you were doing
3740 but for the sincere worshipers of allah
3741 there is waiting for them a known provision
3742 fruits and they are receivers of generosity
3743 in the gardens of delight
3744 sitting face to face upon couches
3745 a goblet from a spring shall be passed round to them
3746 white a delight to the drinkers
3747 there is neither sickness in it nor intoxication
3748 and with them will be maidens houris who restrain their wide glances
3749 as if they were hidden pearls
3750 they will go to one another asking each other questions
3751 one of them will say i had a companion
3752 who would say are you among the believers of the resurrection
3753 when we are dead and turned to dust and bones shall we be recompensed
3754 and he will reply are you looking down into hell
3755 then he will look and see him in the midst of hell
3756 by allah he will say you almost destroyed me
3757 but for the favor of allah i should have surely been among those who were arraigned with you in hell
3758 what then shall we not die
3759 except our first death and shall we not be punished
3760 indeed this is the mighty victory
3761 and for the like of this let the workers work
3762 is this a better hospitality or the tree of azzakkum
3763 we have made this tree a trial for the evildoers
3764 it is a tree that grows from the bottom of hell
3765 its spathes are like the heads of satans
3766 on it they shall feed and with it they shall fill their bellies
3767 on top of it they shall have a brew of boiling water
3768 then their return is to hell
3769 they found their fathers in error
3770 yet they run in their footsteps
3771 yet before them most of the ancients went astray
3772 though we had sent among them warners
3773 see then the end of those who were warned
3774 except the sincere worshipers of allah
3775 noah called to us and we are the best to answer
3776 we saved him and his people from the great distress
3777 and we made his offspring the survivors
3778 and we let it remain upon him in the latter
3779 peace be upon noah among all the worlds
3780 as such we recompense the gooddoers
3781 he was one of our believing worshipers
3782 afterwards we drowned the others
3783 of his party was abraham
3784 remember when he came to his lord with a pure heart
3785 and when he said to his father and to his nation what do you worship
3786 it is falsehood that you desire gods other than allah
3787 what do you think of the lord of the worlds
3788 he cast a glance at the stars
3789 and said surely i am sick of what you worship
3790 but they turned their backs and went away from him
3791 then he turned to their gods and said what do you eat
3792 what is the matter with you that you do not speak
3793 and he turned upon them striking them with the right hand
3794 thereafter they the people came to him in haste
3795 he said do you worship what you yourselves have carved
3796 when it is allah who created you and all that you do
3797 they replied build for him a building and cast him into the fire
3798 their desire was to outwit him but we made them to be the humiliated
3799 he said i will go to my lord he will guide me
37100 my lord grant me a righteous son
37101 and we gave him the glad tidings of a very gentle son ishmael
37102 and when he reached the age of traveling with him he said my son while i was sleeping i saw that i shall slaughter sacrifice you tell me what is your opinion he replied father do as you are ordered by allah allah willing you shall find me one of those who are steadfast
37103 and when they had both submitted and his son had laid down prostrate upon his forehead
37104 we called to him saying o abraham
37105 you have confirmed your vision as such we recompense the gooddoers
37106 that was indeed a clear trial
37107 so we ransomed him with a mighty sacrifice
37108 and we let it the beautiful praise remain upon him in the latter generations
37109 peace be upon abraham
37110 as such we recompense the gooddoers
37111 he was one of our believing worshipers
37112 then we gave him the glad tidings of isaac a prophet one of the righteous
37113 and we blessed him and isaac and from their offspring are some gooddoers and others who clearly wronged themselves
37114 we also favored moses and aaron
37115 and we saved them with their nation from a great distress
37116 we helped them and they became victorious
37117 and we gave them the clear book
37118 and guided them upon the straight path
37119 and we let it the beautiful praise remain upon on both of them in the latter generations
37120 peace be upon moses and aaron
37121 as such we recompense the gooddoers
37122 they were among our believing worshipers
37123 and elias el yaseen was among the messengers
37124 he asked his people do you not fear allah
37125 do you call on balan the idol baal and abandon the best creator
37126 allah is your lord and the lord of your fathers the ancients
37127 but they belied him so they will be among the arraigned in hell
37128 except the sincere worshipers of allah
37129 and we let it the beautiful praise remain upon him in the latter generations
37130 peace be upon el yaseen
37131 as such we recompense the gooddoers
37132 he was among our believing worshipers
37133 lot too was among the messengers
37134 we saved him and all his kinsmen
37135 except an old woman who lingered
37136 and we destroyed the others
37137 you pass by them in the morning
37138 and at night will you not understand
37139 jonah too was one of the messengers
37140 he ran away to the laden ship
37141 and cast lots and he was among the losers of the lots that were cast
37142 so the whale swallowed him for he was blameworthy
37143 and had he not been among those who exalt allah
37144 he would have lingered in its belly till the day they are resurrected
37145 but we cast him upon the shore and he was ill
37146 and we caused a pumpkin tree to grow over him
37147 then we sent him to a hundred thousand or more
37148 and they believed and we gave them enjoyment for awhile
37149 now ask them has your lord daughters and they sons
37150 or did we create the angels females while they were witnessing
37151 then is it of their lying that they say
37152 allah has begotten they are truly liars
37153 has he chosen daughters above sons
37154 what is the matter with you how do you judge
37155 what will you not remember
37156 or do you have a clear authority
37157 bring your book if what you say is true
37158 they assert kinship between him and the angels but the angels know that they the liars will be arraigned in hell
37159 exaltations to allah above what they describe
37160 except for the sincere worshipers of allah
37161 but as for you and that you worship
37162 you shall tempt none against him
37163 except for he who shall roast in hell
37164 gabriel said to the prophet each of us has a known place
37165 we are surely those who are arranged in ranks
37166 and we are they who exalt allah
37167 what would they then say
37168 if only we had a reminder from the ancients
37169 we would have been sincere worshipers of allah
37170 but they disbelieve in it the koran but soon they shall know
37171 our word had already preceded our worshipers the messengers
37172 that they shall receive our help
37173 and our armies shall be the victors
37174 so turn away from them for a while
37175 see them and soon they shall see
37176 what do they seek to hasten our punishment
37177 when it descends upon their courtyards evil will be the morning of those forewarned
37178 so turn away from them for a while
37179 and see soon they shall see
37180 exaltations be to your lord the lord of might above that they describe
37181 peace be on the messengers
37182 and praise belongs to allah lord of the worlds
381 saad by the holy reading koran of the remembrance
382 no the unbelievers exalt in their division
383 how many generations have we destroyed before them they called the time is neither of escape nor safety
384 they marvel now that from among themselves a warner has come to them the unbelievers say this is a lying sorcerer
385 what has he made the gods one god this is indeed a wondrous thing
386 their assembly left saying go and be patient to your gods this is something to be desired
387 we never heard of this in the former religion it is nothing but an invention
388 what out of all of us has the remembrance been sent down to him prophet muhammad no they are doubtful about my remembrance no they have not yet tasted my punishment
389 or have they the treasuries of the mercy of your lord the almighty the giving
3810 or is theirs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them then let them ascend by their means
3811 the army is defeated as were the confederates
3812 before them the nations of noah aad and pharaoh and he of the tentpegs belied
3813 thamood the nation of lot and the dwellers of the thicket such were the confederates
3814 there was not one of those that did not belie the messengers therefore my retribution was realized
3815 these only wait for a single shout for which there will be no delay
3816 they say our lord hasten to us our share before the day of recompense
3817 bear patiently with what they say and remember our worshiper david a man of might he was ever turning in repentance
3818 we subjected the mountains to exalt me with him in the evening and at sunrise
3819 and the birds too gathered each obedient to him
3820 we made his kingdom strong and gave him wisdom and decisive speech
3821 has the news of the dispute reached you prophet muhammad when they scaled the sanctuary
3822 they went to david whereupon he was afraid of them but they said do not be afraid we are two that have a dispute one of us has wronged the other judge between us justly and do not transgress and guide us to the right path
3823 this my brother has ninetynine ewes but i have only one ewe a female sheep he said give her into my keeping and overcame me in the argument
3824 he david replied he has without doubt wronged you in seeking to add your ewe to his sheep many intermixers wrong one another except those who believe and do good works and they are few indeed david realized that we had tried him and sought the forgiveness of his lord and fell down prostrate and repented
3825 so we forgave him that and he has a near place with us and a fine return
3826 we said david we have made you a caliph in the earth judge with justice among people and do not yield to your own preference in case it should lead you from the path of allah surely a terrible punishment awaits those who stray from the path of allah because they forget the day of reckoning
3827 it was not in falsehood that we created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them that is the thought of the unbelievers but woe to the unbelievers because of the fire
3828 are we to make those who believe and do good works the same as those who corrupt the earth are we to make the righteous as the wicked
3829 it is a blessed book that we have sent down to you prophet muhammad so that those possessed with minds might ponder its verses and remember
3830 we gave solomon to david and he was an excellent worshiper he was penitent
3831 when his dressage steeds were presented to him in the evening
3832 he said indeed i have loved the love of good things better than the remembrance of my lord until the sun has vanished behind a veil
3833 bring them back to me and he hacked their legs and necks slaughtering them for allah
3834 indeed we tried solomon and placed a body of a child upon his throne then he repented
3835 he said forgive me my lord and give me a kingdom the like of which will not befall any after me surely you are the giver
3836 so we subjected the wind to him so that it ran softly by his command wherever he wished
3837 and the satans every builder and diver
3838 and others joined together by iron fetters
3839 this is our gift give or withhold without reckoning
3840 and he has a place near to us and a fine return
3841 also remember our worshiper job he called out to his lord saying satan has afflicted me with harm and pain
3842 we said stamp your foot on the ground here is cool water with which to wash and a drink
3843 we restored to him to his family and like those with them a mercy from us and a reminder to a nation that understand
3844 we said to him take a bundle of rushes and strike with it and do not break your oath we found him to be patient a good worshiper and he was penitent
3845 also remember our worshipers abraham isaac and jacob those of might and vision
3846 indeed we purified them with a most pure quality the remembrance of the everlasting life
3847 indeed with us they are among the chosen the excellent
3848 also remember our worshipers ishmael elisha and thulkifl they are among the good
3849 this is a reminder and indeed for the cautious is a fine return
3850 the gardens of eden whose gates shall be open to them
3851 in which they will recline and call for abundant fruit and drink therein
3852 and with them will be maidens of equal age with modest gaze
3853 this is what you are promised on the day of recompense
3854 this is our unending provision
3855 all of this but for the proud there is an ill return
3856 they shall roast in the fire of gehenna an evil cradling
3857 all of this so let them taste it boiling water and pus
3858 and other similar to it joined together
3859 we shall say to their leaders this is a troop rushing in with you there is no welcome for them they shall roast in the fire
3860 but they will say no it is you that has no welcome it was you who brought it upon us an evil place
3861 they will say our lord give those who brought this upon us double the punishment of the fire
3862 and they will say why do we not see the men that we counted as being among the wicked in here
3863 have we taken them in mockery or have our eyes swerved from them
3864 surely that is true the disputing of the inhabitants of the fire
3865 say i am only a warner there is no god except allah the one the conqueror
3866 the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the almighty the forgiving
3867 say this is a mighty message
3868 from which you turn away
3869 i had no knowledge of the high assemblys dispute
3870 this alone is revealed to me i am only a clear warner
3871 when your lord said to the angels i am creating a human from clay
3872 after i have shaped him and breathed of my spirit i created into him fall down prostrate before him
3873 so all the angels prostrated themselves
3874 except iblis satan the father of the jinn he became too proud for he was one of the unbelievers
3875 he allah said iblis what prevented you from prostrating yourself towards that which i have created with my hands have you become too proud or areyou among the grand
3876 he satan replied i am better than he you created me from fire and you created him from clay
3877 begone said he you are stoned
3878 my curse shall rest on you until the day of recompense
3879 he satan replied respite me my lord till the day of resurrection
3880 he allah said you are among those that are respited
3881 till the day of the known time
3882 he satan said i swear by your might that i will seduce all of them
3883 except those among them who are your sincere worshipers
3884 he allah said this is the truth and i speak the truth
3885 i shall certainly fill gehenna with you and every one of them that follows you
3886 say prophet muhammad for this i ask of you no wage and i am not of those who take things upon themselves
3887 this is nothing else but a reminder to all the worlds
3888 and after a while you shall know its news
391 the sending down of the book is from allah the almighty the wise
392 we have sent down the book with the truth to you prophet muhammad therefore worship allah and make your religion sincerely his
393 is it not that the sincere religion belongs to allah as for those who choose guardians other than him saying we only worship them so that they will bring us near to allah indeed allah will judge between them concerning their differences indeed allah does not guide he who is an unthankful liar
394 if allah had desired to take a son he would have chosen whatever he willed out of his creation exaltations to him he is allah the one the conqueror
395 he created the heavens and the earth in truth wrapping the night about the day and wrapping the day about the night he has subjected the sun and the mooneach to run for a stated term is he not the almighty the forgiving
396 he created you from a single soul then from it he created its spouse and he sent down to you eight pairs of the cattle he creates you in your mothers womb creation after creation in three stages of darkness such then is allah your lord for him is the kingdom there is no god except him how then can you turn away
397 if you disbelieve allah is rich independent of you yet he does not approve of disbelief to his worshipers but if you believe he will approve it in you no laden soul shall bear anothers load then to allah you shall return and he will tell to you what you have done he knows the innermost of your chests
398 when an affliction befalls a human he supplicates to his lord and turns to him in repentance yet no sooner does he bestow on him his blessing than he forgets that for which he had just supplicated and sets up associates with allah in order to lead people away from his path say enjoy your disbelief for awhile you shall surely be among the companions of the fire
399 or is he who is obedient that prostrates himself and stands during parts of the night being afraid of the everlasting life but hoping for the mercy of the lord to be compared to the unbeliever say are they equal those who know and those who do not know only those with minds remember
3910 say my worshipers who believe fear your lord for those who do good in this world there is good and the earth of allah is wide surely those who are patient will be recompensed in full without count
3911 say i am ordered to worship allah making my religion sincerely his
3912 i am ordered to be the first of those to be submissive muslims to him
3913 say indeed if i rebel against my lord i fear the punishment of a dreadful day
3914 say i worship allah and make my religion sincerely his
3915 as for yourselves worship what you will other than him say the losers are surely those who lose themselves and their families on the day ofresurrection is that not a clear loss
3916 above them they shall have layers of fire and beneath them layers by this allah puts fear into his worshipers o my worshipers fear me
3917 those who shun the worship of idols and turn in repentance to allah for them glad tidings therefore give good tidings to my worshipers
3918 who listen to the words and follow what is finest of it these are they whom allah has guided they are those of understanding
3919 can you save from the fire he whom against the word of punishment has been realized
3920 as for those who fear their lord there await high mansions above which are built more high mansions beneath which rivers flow such is the promise ofallah allah will not fail his promise
3921 have you not seen how allah sends down water from the sky and threaded it as springs in the earth then he brings forth plants of various colors after which they wither and you see them turning yellow and then he makes them into broken stubble surely in this there is a reminder for those of understanding
3922 is he whose chest allah has expanded to islam so that he walks upon a light from his lord as those whose heart is sealed but woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of allah those are in clear error
3923 allah has sent down the best discourse a book consimilar in its oftrepeated verses that the skins of those who fear their lord tremble and thereafter their skins and hearts soften to the remembrance of allah such is the guidance of allah whereby he guides whosoever he will and whosoever allah leads astray he has no guide
3924 is he whose face is cautious of the evil of the punishment on the day of resurrection to be compared to the unbeliever to the evildoers it shall be saidnow taste that which you have been earning
3925 those who went before them also belied then our punishment overtook them from where they were unaware
3926 allah let them taste degradation in this present life but the punishment of the everlasting life shall be greater if they but knew
3927 indeed we have struck of every manner of parable for mankind in this koran in order that they will remember
3928 it is an arabic koran free from all crookedness in order that they will be cautious
3929 allah has struck an example of a man shared by disagreeing partners and a man who is owned by just one man are the two equally alike praise belongs toallah but most of them do not know
3930 you are mortal and they are mortal
3931 then on the day of resurrection you shall dispute before your lord
3932 who does greater evil than he who lies against allah and belies the truth when it comes to him is there not a lodging in gehenna hell for the unbelievers
3933 and he who comes with the truth and confirms it those are they who surely fear allah
3934 they shall have whatever they want with their lord that is the recompense of the gooddoers
3935 that allah may acquit them of the worst of what they did and recompense with the finest wages for what they did
3936 is it not that allah suffices his worshiper even though they frighten you with those other than him he whom allah leads astray has no guide
3937 but he whom allah guides none can lead astray is not allah the almighty capable of retribution
3938 if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will reply allah say do you think that if allah wills to afflict me those you call upon other than him could remove his affliction or that if he wills to let me have mercy they could withhold his mercy say allah suffices me those who put their trust put their trust in him
3939 say o nation work according to your status i am working according to my status and soon you will know
3940 upon whom the punishment will come that will degrade him and who will be overtaken by an everlasting punishment
3941 surely we have sent down to you the book for mankind with the truth whosoever is guided is guided for himself and he who goes astray it is only for his own loss you prophet muhammad are not their compulsory guardian
3942 allah takes away souls at the time of their death the temporary death of sleep and those who do not die during their sleep he withholds that upon whichhe has decreed death but turns lose the other till a stated term surely there are signs in this for a nation who contemplate
3943 have they chosen other than allah to intercede for them say what even though they have no power at all nor understanding
3944 say intercession belongs altogether to allah his is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth to him you shall be returned
3945 when allah is mentioned alone the hearts of those who do not believe in the everlasting life shrink in aversion but when those other than him are mentioned see they are filled with glad tidings
3946 say o allah the originator of the heavens and the earth who has knowledge of the unseen and visible you shall judge between the differences of your worshipers
3947 on the day of resurrection if the harmdoers owned all that is in the earth and as much again besides they would offer it to ransom themselves from the evil of the punishment from allah will come to them that with which they had never reckoned
3948 and the evils of their earnings will appear to them and that which they mocked at will encompass them
3949 when an affliction befalls a human he calls upon us but when we confer our favor on him he says i have only been given it on account of knowledge rather it is but a trial yet most do not know
3950 those before them said the same but what they earned did not help them
3951 and the evil of their earnings coiled upon them the harmdoers among these will also be coiled by the evils of their earnings they will be unable to defeat it
3952 do they not know that allah outspreads and withholds his provision to whosoever he will surely there are signs in this for a believing nation
3953 say o my worshipers who have sinned excessively against themselves do not despair of the mercy of allah surely allah forgives all sins he is theforgiver the most merciful
3954 turn to your lord and surrender yourselves to him before the punishment overtakes you for then you will not be helped
3955 follow the best of what has been sent down from your lord before the punishment overtakes you suddenly while you are unaware
3956 lest any soul should say sadly i have neglected my duty to allah and was of those that mocked
3957 or lest it should say if allah had only guided me i would have been one of the cautious
3958 or lest when it sees the punishment should say o that i might return and be among those that did good
3959 indeed my verses did come to you but you belied them you were proud and became one of the unbelievers
3960 on the day of resurrection you shall see those who lied about allah with blackened faces in gehenna is there not a lodging for those who were proud
3961 but allah will save those who fear him with their winnings paradise no evil shall touch them nor shall they ever grieve
3962 allah is the creator of all things and of all things he is the guardian
3963 to him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth those who disbelieve in the verses of allah they are the losers
3964 say o you who are ignorant is it other than allah that you would order me to worship
3965 it has already been revealed to you and to those who have gone before you that if you associate partners with allah your works would be annulled and you will be among the losers
3966 no worship allah and be with those who give thanks
3967 they have not valued allah with his true value but on the day of resurrection the entire earth will be in his grip and the heavens shall be rolled up upon in his right exaltations to him exalted high is he above all that they associate
3968 the horn shall be blown and all who are in heavens and earth shall swoon except those whom allah wills then the horn will blow again and they shall stand and gaze
3969 the earth will shine with the light of its lord and the book of deeds will be set in place the prophets and witnesses shall be brought and the matter will be justly decided between them and they will not be wronged
3970 every soul shall be paid in full according to what it has done for he knows well what they did
3971 in companies the unbelievers shall be driven into gehenna as they draw near its gates will be opened and its keepers will ask them did there not come to you messengers of your own who recited to you the verses of your lord and warned you of the encounter of this your day yes indeed they will answer and the word of the punishment has been realized against the unbelievers
3972 it will be said to them enter the gates of gehenna and live there for ever evil is the lodging place of the proud
3973 then those that feared their lord shall be driven in companies into paradise when they draw near its gates will be opened and its keepers will say to them peace be upon you you have done well enter and live in it for ever
3974 they will say praise belongs to allah who has been true to his promise to us and given us the earth to inherit that we shall live in paradise wherever we wish how excellent is the recompense of those that labor
3975 and you shall see the angels encircling the throne exalting with the praise of their lord and the matter will be justly decided between them and it shall be said praise belongs to allah lord of all the worlds
401 hameem
402 the sending down of the book is from allah the almighty the knower
403 the forgiver of sins and the acceptor of repentance stern in retribution the bountiful there is no god except he and to him is the arrival
404 none but the unbelievers dispute concerning the verses of allah so do not be deluded by their going to and fro in the land
405 the nation of noah before them belied and so did the parties after them every nation strove against their messenger to seize him disputing with false arguments to refute the truth then i seized them how was my punishment
406 and so it is that the word of your lord shall be realized against the unbelievers they are the inhabitants of the fire
407 those who bear the throne and those around it exalt with the praise of their lord and believe in him they ask forgiveness for the believers saying our lord you embrace all things in mercy and knowledge forgive those who repent and follow your way shield them against the punishment of hell
408 admit them our lord to the gardens of eden which you have promised them together with those who were righteous among their fathers their wives and their offspring you are the almighty the wise
409 and guard them against all evil deeds whosoever you guarded against evil deeds on that day surely you have had mercy upon them and that is indeed the mighty triumph
4010 it shall be proclaimed to the unbelievers surely the hatred of allah for you is greater than your hatred of yourselves you were called to belief but disbelieved
4011 they shall say our lord twice you have made us die and twice you have given us life now we confess our sins is there any way we can be brought out of this
4012 they shall be answered that is because you disbelieved when allah alone was supplicated to but when others were associated with him you believed judgement belongs to allah the most high the great
4013 it is he who shows to you his signs and sends down your provision from the sky yet no one remembers except he who is penitent
4014 supplicate then to allah making your religion sincerely his even though the unbelievers oppose it
4015 exalter in ranks owner of the throne he lets the spirit the revelation descend at his order on those of his worshipers whom he chooses in order that he warns of the day of the meeting
4016 the day when they shall rise up with nothing hidden from allah and who is the owner of the kingdom on that day allah the one the conqueror
4017 on that day every soul shall be recompensed for its earnings and on that day none shall be wronged the reckoning of allah is swift
4018 warn them against the imminent day when choking with anguish the hearts will be in their throats the harmdoers will not have a single loyal friend and there will be no intercessor to be obeyed
4019 he allah knows the furtive looks of the eyes and what the chests conceal
4020 with justice allah will judge but those upon whom they call other than him can not judge anything at all allah is the hearer the seer
4021 have they never journeyed through the land and seen what was the end of those who have gone before them they were stronger than themselves in might and left firmer traces in the earth but allah seized them for their sinning and they had none to protect them from allah
4022 that was because they disbelieved their messengers when they came to them with clear signs and so allah seized them surely he is strong and stern in retribution
4023 we sent moses with our signs and with clear authority
4024 to pharaoh haman and korah but they said a sorcerer a liar
4025 and when he brought them the truth from us they said kill the sons of those who believe with him but spare their women but the scheming of the unbelievers is always in error
4026 pharaoh said let me kill moses then let him call to his lord i am fearful that he will change your religion or cause mischief in the land
4027 moses said i take refuge in my lord and in your lord from every proud person who does not believe in day of reckoning
4028 but one of pharaohs people who was in secret a believer asked would you kill a man because he says my lord is allah he has brought you clear signs from your lord if he is lying let his lie be on his head but if he is speaking the truth then at least a part of what he promises will befall you allah does not guide the lying sinner
4029 o my nation today the kingdom is yours and you are the masters in the land but if the might of allah should come against us who will help us pharaoh said i only let you see what i see i guide you to the path of righteousness
4030 the one who believed said i fear for you the like of the day of the confederates my nation
4031 or something similar to the circumstances of the nations of noah aad and thamood and those who came after them allah does not want to wrong his worshipers
4032 and my nation i fear for you the day of calling
4033 the day when you will turn in retreat with none to protect you from allah he whom allah leads astray has no guide
4034 before this joseph brought you clear signs but you continued to be doubtful of that which he brought when he passed away you said allah will never send another messenger after him as such allah leads astray the sinner the doubter
4035 those who dispute the signs of allah without any authority having reached them are very hateful before allah and the believers as such allah sets a seal on every heart that is proud and arrogant
4036 pharaoh said haman build me a tower that i can reach the ways
4037 the ways of heaven so that i may look upon the god of moses because i think that he is a liar and so pharaohs evil deeds were made to seem fair to him and he was barred from the way and pharaohs guile came to nothing except ruin
4038 he who was a believer said follow me my nation so that i may guide you to the right path
4039 o my nation the life of this world is nothing but an enjoyment but surely the life of the everlasting life is the stable abode
4040 those who do an evil deed shall only be rewarded with its like but those who believe and do good works either men and women shall enter the gardens of paradise and are provided for without reckoning
4041 my nation how is it that i call you to salvation and you call me to the fire
4042 you call me to disbelieve in allah and to associate with him that of which i know nothing while i call you to the almighty the forgiving
4043 there is no doubt that what you call me to has neither a call in this world nor in the everlasting life to allah we shall return and the excessive sinners are the inhabitants of the fire
4044 you will remember what i say to you to allah i commit my affair surely allah sees his worshipers
4045 allah saved him from the evils that they devised and an evil punishment encompassed pharaohs people
4046 before the fire they shall be exposed morning and evening and on the day when the hour comes it will be said admit the family of pharaoh into the most terrible punishment
4047 and when they argue with one another in hell the weak will say to the proud we were your followers will you help us against any share of the fire
4048 but those who were proud will reply all of us are in it hell allah has judged between his worshipers
4049 and those in the fire will say to the keepers of gehenna hell call your lord to lessen our punishment for one day
4050 but they will say did your messengers not come to you with clear signs yes indeed they will answer and they will reply then you call but the calling of the unbelievers is only in error
4051 surely we shall help our messengers and the believers both in this world and on the day when the witnesses rise
4052 on that day no excuse will benefit the harmdoers theirs shall be the curse and an evil lodging
4053 we gave moses the guidance and bequeathed upon the children of israel the book
4054 for guidance and a reminder for those of understanding
4055 therefore have patience the promise of allah is true and ask forgiveness of your sins and exalt with the praise of your lord in the evening and at dawn
4056 as for those who dispute the verses of allah without authority having been given to them there is nothing in their chests but pride that they shall never attain therefore seek refuge in allah surely he is the hearer the seer
4057 indeed the creation of heavens and earth is greater than the creation of mankind yet most people do not know
4058 the blind and the seeing are not equal nor are those who believe and do good works and the wrongdoer yet you seldom reflect
4059 there is no doubt that the hour is coming yet most people do not believe
4060 your lord has said call on me and i will answer you those who are too proud to worship me shall enter gehenna utterly abject
4061 it is allah who made for you the night in which to rest and the day to see allah is bountiful to the people yet most people do not give thanks
4062 such is allah your lord the creator of all things there is no god except he how then can you turn away from him
4063 as such those who disbelieve the signs of allah turn away
4064 it is allah who has given you the earth as a fixed place and the heaven for a canopy he has shaped you and made you fine images and provided you with goodness such is allah your lord blessed be allah lord of all the worlds
4065 he is the living there is no god except he supplicate to him and make the religion sincerely his praise belongs to allah lord of the worlds
4066 say i am forbidden to worship those whom you worship other than allah clear verses have come to me from my lord and i am commanded to surrender to the lord of the worlds
4067 it is he who created you from dust then from a sperm drop and then a blood clot he then brings you forth as an infant then you reach your strength after which you come of age though some of you die before it and that you reach an appointed term in order that you understand
4068 it is he who gives life and makes to die and when he decrees a thing he says to it be and it is
4069 do you not see how those who dispute about the verses of allah how they are turned about
4070 those who belie the book and that with which we sent our messengers shall soon know
4071 when the fetters and chains are round their necks they shall be dragged
4072 into boiling water then into the fire they shall be poured
4073 it will then be asked of them where are those whom you associated
4074 other than allah they will reply they have gone astray from us indeed what we used to call upon before is nothing accordingly allah leads the unbelievers astray
4075 and it will be said that is because you rejoiced on earth in things of which you had no right and were very happy
4076 enter the gates of gehenna and live there for ever evil is the lodging of the proud
4077 therefore have patience the promise of allah is true whether we show you something of that we promise them or call you to us to us they shall all return
4078 we sent other messengers before you of some we have already told you of others we have not told you yet it was not for any messenger to bring a verse except by the permission of allah and when the command of allah comes the matter will be justly decided and the vaindoers will be lost
4079 it is allah who has provided you with cattle some that you ride and some that you eat
4080 and for you there are other uses in them and that upon them you may reach a need in your chests and upon them and on ships you are carried
4081 he shows you his signs now which of the signs of allah do you disbelieve
4082 have they never journeyed through the land and seen what was the end of those who have gone before them they were stronger than themselves in might and left firmer traces upon the earth yet whatsoever they earned did not help them
4083 when their messengers brought them clear verses they rejoiced in such knowledge as they had but they were encompassed by that which they mocked
4084 and when they saw our might they said we believe in allah alone and we disbelieve in that we used to associate with him
4085 but when they saw our might their belief did not benefit them it is the way of allah that has passed concerning his worshipers there the unbelievers shall be lost
411 hameem
412 a sending down from the merciful the most merciful
413 a book the verses of which are distinguished an arabic koran for a nation who know
414 it bears glad tidings and a warning yet most of them turn away and do not listen
415 they say our hearts are veiled from that to which you call us and in our ears there is heaviness and between us and you is a veil so work as you will and we are working
416 say prophet muhammad i am only a human like you to whom it is revealed that your god is one god therefore be straight with him and ask him to forgive you woe to the idolaters
417 who do not pay charity and disbelieve in the everlasting life
418 for those who believe and do good works is an enduring wage
419 say do you disbelieve in him who created the earth in two days and do you set up equals with him he is the lord of the worlds
4110 he set firm mountains on top of the earth and he blessed it and in four days he ordained in it many provisions equal to those who ask
4111 then he willed to the heaven when it was smoke and to it and the earth he said come willingly or unwillingly we come willingly they answered
4112 in two days he determined them seven heavens and he revealed to each heaven its commands we decorated the lowest heaven with lamps and preserve them such is the decree of the almighty the knower
4113 but if they turn away say i have given you warning of a thunderbolt similar to that which overtook aad and thamood
4114 when their messengers came to them from before them and behind them saying worship none except allah they answered had it been the will of our lord he would have sent down angels so we disbelieve in the message with which you were sent
4115 as for aad they behaved proudly in the earth without right who is stronger than us they would say could they not see that allah who created them is stronger than they but they disbelieved our signs
4116 then on the ominous days we loosed against them a howling wind that we might let them taste the punishment of humiliation in this life but more humiliating will be the punishment of the everlasting life and they will not be helped
4117 as for thamood we offered them our guidance but they preferred blindness to guidance so a thunderbolt of the humiliating punishment seized them because of what they had earned
4118 and we saved those who believed and feared allah
4119 on the day when the enemies of allah will be rightfully gathered together before fire
4120 when they reach it their hearing eyes and skins will testify against them for what they were doing
4121 why did you bear witness against us they will ask their skins and they will reply allah has given us speech as he has given speech to everything it was he who created you the first time and to him you shall return
4122 it is not that you covered yourselves so that your hearing eyes and skin could not bear witness against you but you thought that allah did not know much of that which you do
4123 rather it is the thoughts you thought about your lord that have destroyed you therefore this morning you find yourselves among the losers
4124 even if they are patient the fire shall still be their lodging and if they seek pardon they shall not be among those who are pardoned
4125 we have assigned companions to them who make what is before them and behind them seem fair to them the statement has been realized against them in nations of people and jinn alike that passed away before them they were indeed the losers
4126 the unbelievers say do not listen to this koran and talk idly about it so that you might be overcome
4127 we will let the unbelievers taste a terrible punishment and recompense them with the worst of what they were doing
4128 the fire that is the recompense of the enemies of allah there it is that they will be lodged for eternity a recompense for their disbelief of our verses
4129 the unbelievers will say lord show us the jinn and people who led us astray to put them under our feet so that they are among the lowest
4130 the angels will descend on those who said allah is our lord and have then gone straight saying be neither fearful nor sad rejoice in the paradise you have been promised
4131 we are your guides in this world and in the everlasting life there you shall have all that your souls desire and all that you ask for
4132 as hospitality from one the forgiving the most merciful
4133 and who is better in saying than he who invites to allah does what is right and says surely i am of those who surrender
4134 good and evil deeds are not equal repel with that which is most just and see the one whom there is enmity between you will be as if he were a loyal guide
4135 but none will receive it except those who are patient and none shall receive it except he who has a great share
4136 if a provocation from satan should provoke you seek refuge in allah he is the hearer the knower
4137 among his signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon but do not prostrate yourselves before the sun or the moon rather prostrate before allah who created them both if it is he whom you worship
4138 but if they become proud those who are with your lord exalt him by day and night and never grow weary
4139 and among his signs is that you see the earth humble then when he sends down rain upon it it quivers and swells he who revives is he who revives the dead surely he is powerful over everything
4140 those who disbelieve our verses when it comes to them are not hidden from us is he who is cast in the fire better than he who comes in safety on the day of resurrection do as you will surely he sees the things you do
4141 those who disbelieve in the remembrance when it comes to them and indeed this is a mighty book
4142 falsehood does not come to it from before it or from behind it it is a sending down from the one the wise the praised
4143 nothing that is said to you has not already been said to other messengers before you indeed your lord is a lord of forgiveness but stern in retribution
4144 had we made the koran in a nonarabic language they would have said if only its verses were distinguished why in a nonarabic language when theprophet is an arab say to the believers it is a guidance and a healing but to those who do not believe there is a heaviness in their ears to them it is blindness they are those called from afar
4145 we gave the book to moses but there were disputes about it and had it not been for a word that preceded from your lord their disputes would have been decided between them but they are in disquieting doubt about it
4146 he who does good does it for himself and he who does evil does so against it your lord never wrongs his worshipers
4147 to him is referred the knowledge of the hour no fruit sprouts forth from its sheath no female conceives or is delivered except with his knowledge on the day he will call to them where then are my associates they will reply we proclaim to you that none of us can bear witness
4148 those they used to call upon before will go away from them and they shall think that they have no asylum
4149 mankind never wearies of supplicating for goodness but when evil befalls him he is downcast and grows desperate
4150 and if we give him a taste of mercy from us after his affliction has befallen him he is sure to say this is my own i do not think the hour will ever come and even if i am returned to my lord with him there is for me the finest reward paradise then we shall tell the unbelievers what they did and let them taste a harsh punishment
4151 when we favor a human he swerves away and withdraws aside but when evil befalls him he is full of unending prayer
4152 say think if this koran is indeed from allah and you disbelieve in it who is further astray than he who is in a wide schism
4153 we will show them our signs in all the horizons and in themselves until it is clear to them that it is the truth is it not sufficient that your lord is witness over everything
4154 are they not in doubt concerning the meeting with their lord attention he encompasses everything
421 hameem
422 aeenseenqaaf
423 as such allah the almighty the wise reveals to you prophet muhammad and to those before you
424 to him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth he is the high the exalted
425 the heavens nearly break apart above them as the angels exalt with the praise of their lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth indeed allah is the forgiving the most merciful
426 as for those who take guardians for themselves other than him allah is the warden over them you are not a guardian over them
427 as such we have revealed to you an arabic koran so that you can warn the mother of villages mecca and all who live about it and that you also warn them of the day of gathering in which there is no doubt that a division will be in paradise and a division in the blaze
428 had it been the will of allah he would have made them all one nation but he admits into his mercy whom he will the harmdoers shall have neither a guardian nor helper
429 or have they taken to themselves guardians other than him but allah he is the guardian he revives the dead and has power over all things
4210 whatever you differ upon its judgement belongs to allah such is allah my lord in him i have put my trust and to him i turn in repentance
4211 the originator of the heavens and the earth he has given you from yourselves pairs and also pairs of cattle thereby multiplying you there is nothing like him he is the hearer the seer
4212 to him belongs the keys of the heavens and the earth he outspreads and withholds his provisions to whom he will surely he has knowledge of all things
4213 he has made plain for you the religion with which he charged noah and that which we have revealed to you and that with which we charged prophets abraham moses and jesus saying establish the religion and do not be divided therein that which you invite them to is too overwhelming for the idolaters allah brings close to himself whom he will and guides to him those who turn in repentance
4214 yet they became divided only after knowledge had reached them from their own insolence and had it not been for a word that had preceded from yourlord till an appointed term it would have been determined between them but those who inherited the book after them are in disquieting doubt about it
4215 so invite and go straight as you are ordered and do not follow their desires and say i believe in whatever book allah has sent down i am ordered to be just among you allah is our lord and your lord we have our deeds and you have yours there is no argument between us and you allah will bring us all together to him is the arrival
4216 as for those who argue concerning allah after being answered their arguments will be annulled before their lord and his wrath will fall upon them and for them there is a terrible punishment
4217 it is allah who has sent down the book in truth and the scale and what will let you know the hour is near
4218 those who disbelieve in it seek to hasten it but the believers are in fear of it knowing it to be the truth indeed those who doubt the hour have strayed far away
4219 allah is subtle towards his worshipers and provides for whosoever he will he is the strong the almighty
4220 whoever hopes for the tillage of the everlasting life we will increase his tillage and whoever hopes for the tillage of this world we give him some of it but in the everlasting life he shall have no share
4221 or do they have associates who have made lawful to them in religion what allah has not permitted had it not been for the decisive word it would have been decided between them for the evildoers there is a painful punishment
4222 you shall see the harmdoers in fear of what they have earned as it is about to fall on them but those who believe and do good deeds shall live in the meadows of the gardens and from their lord they will have all that they desire that is the great bounty
4223 this is the glad tidings that allah gives to his worshipers who believe and do good works say for this i ask of you no wage except the love of the prophets relatives we will add good to whosoever gains a good deed allah is the forgiving and the thanker
4224 or do they say he has forged a lie about allah but if allah wills he could set a seal upon your heart allah wipes out falsehood and verifies the truth by his words he knows the innermost of the chests
4225 it is he who accepts the repentance of his worshipers and pardons their evil deeds he has knowledge of what you do
4226 he answers those who believe and do good deeds and he increases them from his bounty but for the unbelievers there is a terrible punishment
4227 if allah had expanded his provision to his worshipers they would become tyrannical in the earth but he sends down to them what he will in due measure he is aware and sees his worshipers
4228 it is he who sends down rain for them after they despaired and he unfolds his mercy he is the guardian the praised
4229 among his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the crawling things which he has dispersed in them if he will he is able to gather all of them
4230 if affliction befalls you it is what your own hands have earned but he pardons a lot
4231 you are not able to frustrate him in the earth nor do you have a guardian and a helper other than allah
4232 and among his signs are the ships that run on the sea like mountains and
4233 if he will he calms the wind so that they remain motionless upon its back surely there are signs in this for every thankful patient person
4234 or he wrecks them for what they have earned but he pardons a lot
4235 those who dispute our verses may know that they have no asylum
4236 that which you have been given is but the enjoyment of the present life better and more enduring is that which allah has for those who believe and put their trust in their lord
4237 and those who avoid the major sins and indecencies and when angered forgive
4238 those who answer their lord establish the prayers and their affairs are by consultation who spend of that which we have given them
4239 and when harmed they become victorious
4240 the recompense of a sin is a sin like it but whosoever forgives and seeks to reform his wage will be with allah surely he does not love the harmdoers
4241 and whosoever harms after he has been harmed there is no blame upon them
4242 the blame is only against those who wrong people and are wrongfully insolent in the earth for them there is a painful punishment
4243 surely he who bears patiently and forgives indeed that is true constancy
4244 he whom allah leads astray has none to protect him thereafter you will see the harmdoers when they see the punishment saying is there a way back
4245 you shall see them exposed before it humbled in shame and looking upon it with a furtive glance and the believers will say indeed the losers are they who lose themselves and their families on the day of resurrection the harmdoers shall suffer an everlasting punishment
4246 they shall have none to protect or help them other than allah he whom allah leads astray there is no way for him
4247 answer your lord before that day arrives which cannot be turned back from allah for you on that day there shall be neither shelter nor denial
4248 but if they turn away we have not sent you prophet muhammad to be their compulsory guardian it is only for you to deliver the message when we give the human a taste of our mercy he rejoices because of it but when because of what he has earned evil befalls him the human is ungrateful
4249 to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth he creates what he will he gives females to whom he will and males to whom he will
4250 or he couples them both males and females and to others if he will he makes them barren surely he is the knower the powerful
4251 it does not belong to any human that allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a veil or that he sent a messenger to revealwhatsoever he will by his permission he is the high the wise
4252 as such we have revealed to you prophet muhammad a spirit the revelation of the koran from our ordinance you did not know what the book was nor belief but we made it a light whereby we guide those of our worshipers whom we will and you prophet muhammad you surely guide to a straight path
4253 the path of allah to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth surely to allah all things return
431 hameem
432 by the clear book
433 we have made it an arabic koran in order that you understand
434 it is in the origin of the book with us sublime and wise
435 shall we turn away the remembrance from you because you are a sinful nation
436 how many a prophet did we send to the ancients
437 no prophet came to them except that they mocked him
438 so we destroyed those who were mightier in courage than they and the example of the ancients has passed away
439 yet if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will answer the almighty the knower created them
4310 it is he who made the earth to be a cradle for you and made in it ways for you in order that you are guided
4311 and it is he who sends down water from the sky in its measure thereby we revive the land that was dead as such you shall be brought forth
4312 and it is he who has created all the pairs and appointed for you ships and the cattle on which you ride
4313 so that you can sit upon their backs and then remember the favors of your lord and say exaltations to him who has subjected these to us otherwise we ourselves were not capable of it
4314 indeed to our lord we are turning
4315 yet they assign to him some of his own created worshipers clearly the human is unthankful
4316 or has he taken daughters from those he has created for himself and favored sons for you
4317 yet when one of them is given glad news of a daughter that which he likened to the merciful his face darkens and he chokes inwardly with gloom
4318 as such they attribute to allah who is brought up among ornaments but when disputes arise are powerless
4319 they claim that the angels who are themselves the worshipers of the merciful are females did they witness their creation their witness shall be written down and they shall be questioned
4320 they say had it been the will of the merciful we would never have worshipped them of this they have no knowledge they are but guessing
4321 or have we given them a book before this which they hold fast to
4322 no but they say we found our fathers following a creed and by following in their footsteps we are guided
4323 as such we never sent a warner before you to a village except those living in luxury said we found our fathers following a creed and by following in their footsteps we are guided
4324 say what then if i bring you a better guidance than that you found your fathers following but they reply we disbelieve in that you have been sent with
4325 so we took vengeance upon them and see how the end was of those who lied
4326 remember when abraham said to his father and his nation i am quit from what you worship
4327 except him who originated me for he will guide me
4328 he made this an abiding word among his descendants in order that they would return
4329 i gave them and their fathers days of enjoyment until the truth and a clear messenger came to them
4330 but when the truth came to them they said this is sorcery we disbelieve in it
4331 they also said why was this koran not sent down to a great man from the two villages
4332 what is it they who divide the mercy of your lord it is we who divided between them their livelihoods in this life raising some in rank above others sothat some may take the other into his service your lords mercy is better than all they gather
4333 if it were not that mankind would be one nation we would have made for whosoever disbelieves in the merciful silver roofs upon their houses and stairs toclimb
4334 with doors to their houses and couches on which to recline
4335 and gold surely all this is but the enjoyment of this present life the everlasting life with your lord is for those who fear him
4336 to whosoever blinds himself from the remembrance of the merciful we shall assign him a satan so he is his companion
4337 and they bar them from the way though they themselves think that they are guided
4338 and when he comes before us he shall say would that there had been between me and you the distance of the two easts evil is the companion
4339 because of the harm you did it would be of no benefit to you today you are partners in the punishment
4340 what will you make the deaf hear or guide the blind and he who is in clear error
4341 even if we take you away we shall take vengeance upon them
4342 or we show you a part of that which we have promised them for indeed we have power over them
4343 therefore hold fast to that which is revealed to you indeed you are on the straight path
4344 it is indeed a reminder to you and to your nation and without doubt you shall be questioned
4345 ask our messengers whom we sent before you if we have ever made gods other than the merciful to be worshipped
4346 we sent moses with our signs to pharaoh and his council and he said i am the messenger of the lord of the worlds
4347 but when he showed them our signs they laughed at them
4348 yet there was not a sign that we showed them that was not greater than its sister and we seized them with the punishment so that they might return
4349 sorcerer they said pray to your lord for us in accordance to the covenant he has made with you and surely we shall be rightly guided
4350 but when we had relieved them of their punishment they broke their promise
4351 then pharaoh made a proclamation to his people my people is the kingdom of egypt not mine and these rivers which flow beneath me what can you not see
4352 am i not better than this contemptible man who can scarcely make things clear because of the impediment of his speech
4353 why have no armlets of gold been given him or angels sent down successively with him
4354 he pharaoh intimidated his nation so they obeyed him for they were a sinning nation
4355 and when they angered us we took vengeance on them and drowned all of them
4356 and we made them a thing of the past and we made them an example to later people
4357 when the son of mary is mentioned as an example your people turn away from it
4358 and say what are our gods better or is he they do not mention him to you except to dispute truly they are a contentious nation
4359 he prophet jesus was only a worshiper whom we favored and we made him an example to the children of israel
4360 had it been our will we would have made angels among you as successors in the earth
4361 it is the knowledge of the hour have no doubt concerning it and follow me this is a straight path
4362 and do let satan prevent you for he is your clear enemy
4363 and when prophet jesus came with clear signs he said i have come to you with wisdom and to clarify to you some of the matters about which you differ fear allah and obey me
4364 indeed allah is my lord and your lord therefore worship him that is the straight path
4365 yet the parties differed among themselves so woe to those who did evil among the punishment of a painful day
4366 are they looking for anything except the hour to overtake them it will come upon them suddenly when they are unaware
4367 on that day close friends shall become enemies of each other except those who fear allah
4368 o my worshipers there is no fear for you on this day nor will you grieve
4369 to those who believed in our verses and were muslims
4370 it will be said you and your spouses enter walking with joy into paradise
4371 to them will be passed large platters and cups of gold there will be all that souls desire and all that eyes delight in and it will be said there you shall live for ever
4372 such is the paradise you shall inherit for the things you did
4373 you shall have therein abundant fruit to eat
4374 but the evildoers shall live for ever in the punishment of gehenna hell
4375 which will not be lightened for them and therein they shall be silent
4376 we did not wrong them but they were harmdoers
4377 o malik the angel of hell they will call out let your lord put an end to us but he will answer here you shall stay
4378 we brought you the truth but most of you were averse to the truth
4379 or have they devised a matter we are devising
4380 do they think we do not hear their secret and that which they conspire yes indeed our angels who are present with them write it down
4381 say prophet muhammad if the merciful had a son i would be the first of the worshipers
4382 exaltations be to the lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of the throne above that which they describe
4383 let them alone to plunge and play until they encounter that day of theirs which they are promised
4384 he who is god in the heavens is also god in the earth he is the wise the knower
4385 exaltations to him to whom belong the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them with him is the knowledge of the hour and tohim you shall be returned
4386 those whom they call upon other than him have no power to intercede for them except those that have knowingly borne witness to the truth
4387 yet if you ask them who created you they will say allah how then can they turn away from him
4388 and for his saying my lord these are an unbelieving nation
4389 pardon them and say peace soon they will know
441 hameem
442 by the clear book
443 that we sent down during a blessed night we are ever warning
444 in it every wise matter is determined
445 an order from us we are ever sending
446 a mercy from your lord he is the hearer the knower
447 lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if you are certain of your faith
448 there is no god except he he revives and causes to die he is your lord and the lord of your fathers the ancients
449 yet they are in doubt playing
4410 watch for the day when the heaven will bring clear smoke
4411 engulfing the people this will be a painful punishment
4412 our lord remove this punishment from us we are believers
4413 but how will they avail themselves of the reminder when a clear messenger had already come to them
4414 but then they turned away from him saying he is tutored mad
4415 we are removing the punishment a little but you revert
4416 but on that day we will assault them most mightily and then we shall revenge
4417 we tried pharaohs nation before them a noble messenger came to them
4418 saying be obedient to me o worshipers of allah i am your honest messenger
4419 do not rise up against allah i come to you with clear authority
4420 i take refuge with my lord and your lord lest you stone me
4421 and if you do not believe me then leave me
4422 then he supplicated to his lord saying these are sinful people
4423 his lord answered set out with my worshipers in the night for you will surely be followed
4424 then leave the sea calm they are an army that will be drowned
4425 how many gardens and fountains did they leave behind
4426 and sown fields fine sitting places
4427 and good things in which they took delight
4428 as such it was and we made other people inherit them
4429 neither heaven nor earth shed tears for them nor were they respited
4430 and we saved the children of israel from a humiliating punishment
4431 from pharaoh who ranked high in sin
4432 and we chose them out of a knowledge above the nations of their time
4433 and gave signs to them in which there was a clear trial
4434 yet these say
4435 there is nothing except the first death we shall never be revived
4436 bring us our fathers if what you say is true
4437 are they better or the people of tubba and those who were before them whom we destroyed indeed they were sinners
4438 it was not in play that we created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
4439 we created them in nothing else except the truth but most do not know
4440 the day of decision is the appointed time for all
4441 on that day no cousin shall help his cousin and they shall not be helped
4442 except those on whom allah will have mercy he is the almighty the most merciful
4443 the food of the zakkum tree
4444 shall be the food of the guilty sinners
4445 like molten copper boiling in the belly
4446 as the boiling of the hot water
4447 seize him and drag him into the center of hell
4448 then pour the punishment of boiling water over his head
4449 saying taste surely you are the mighty and noble
4450 this is that which you doubted
4451 indeed for those who feared allah is a secure place
4452 amidst gardens and fountains
4453 dressed in silks and brocade set face to face
4454 as such we shall wed them to wideeyed houris the virgins of paradise
4455 there in security they will call for every kind of fruit
4456 there they shall not taste death except the first death and he will shield them from the punishment of hell
4457 as a bounty from your lord that will be the mighty triumph
4458 we have now made it easy on your tongue in order that they remember
4459 so be watchful they too are watching
451 hameem
452 the sending down of the book is from allah the almighty the wise
453 indeed there are signs in the heavens and earth for believers
454 and in your creation and in the crawling things that he has scattered far and near there are signs for a nation whose belief is certain
455 and in the alternation of the night and day in the provision allah sends down from heaven with which the earth is revived after its death and in the changing about of the winds there are signs for people who understand
456 such are the verses of allah we recite them to you in truth so in what speech after allah and his signs will they believe
457 woe to all the guilty impostors
458 he hears the verses of allah recited to him and then as though he never heard them persists in insolence give to him the glad tidings of a painful punishment
459 as for he who knows something of our verses and then mocks them for those there is a humiliating punishment
4510 gehenna hell is behind them all that they have earned shall not help them at all nor shall those they took as guardians other than allah for them there is a mighty punishment
4511 this is guidance for those who disbelieve in the verses of their lord the anger of the painful punishment awaits them
4512 it is allah who has subjected to you the sea so that ships run upon it at his command and so that you may seek his bounty and be thankful
4513 he has subjected to you whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth all is from him surely there are signs in this for people who contemplate
4514 tell the believers to forgive those who do not look for the days of allah so that he recompenses the people for what they have earned
4515 he who does what is right does it for his own gain and he who does evil does so at his own loss then to your lord you shall all return
4516 we gave to the children of israel the book judgment and prophethood we provided them with good things and preferred them above the worlds of theirtime
4517 we gave them clear signs of the command yet it was not until after knowledge had come to them that they differed among themselves and were insolent to each other on the day of resurrection your lord will indeed decide their differences
4518 and now we have set you on the jurisprudence of the command therefore follow it and do not follow the desires of those who do not know
4519 indeed they will not help you at all against allah the harmdoers are guides of each other but allah is the guide of the cautious
4520 these are clear proofs for people a guidance and mercy for those who are certain of the resurrection in belief
4521 do those who commit evil deeds think that we will make them equal to the believers who do good works so that in life and death they shall be alike how evil they judge
4522 allah created the heavens and the earth in truth and that each soul shall be recompensed for what it earned they shall not be wronged
4523 have you seen he who took his desire for a god with knowledge allah has led him astray setting a seal upon his hearing and heart and has made a veil over his eyes who then shall guide him after allah will you not then remember
4524 they say there is nothing except this life we die and we live it is only time that destroys us surely of this they have no knowledge they are just guessing
4525 and when our verses are recited to them their only argument is bring our fathers back to us if what you say is true
4526 say allah revives you and causes you to die then he shall gather you on the day of resurrection and of this there is no doubt yet most people do notknow
4527 to allah belongs the kingdom in the heavens and the earth on the day when the hour comes those who disbelieved shall be the losers
4528 you shall see every nation hobbling on their knees each nation shall be summoned to its book and it will be said this day you shall be recompensedfor what you were doing
4529 this is our book that speaks with the truth over you we have recorded all that you were doing
4530 as for those who have believed and done good works their lord will admit them into his mercy that is a mighty triumph
4531 but to the unbelievers it will be said were my verses not recited to you but you were proud and were you not a sinful nation
4532 when it was said the promise of allah is true and of the hour there is no doubt you replied we do not know what the hour is we guess assuming and we are by no means certain
4533 the evil of their deeds will appear to them and they shall be encompassed by that they mocked
4534 and it shall be said today we will forget you as you yourselves forgot that you would encounter this day the fire shall be your refuge and none will help you
4535 that is because you took the verses of allah the koran in mockery and you were deluded by your worldly life so that day they will not be brought outof it nor shall they be repentant
4536 praise belongs to allah the lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of the worlds
4537 his is the pride in the heavens and earth he is the almighty the wise
461 hameem
462 the sending down of the book is from allah the almighty the wise
463 it was in truth that we created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for an appointed term yet the unbelievers do not turn away from that which they were warned
464 say have you seen those whom you call upon other than allah show me what they have created from the earth or do they have a partnership in theheavens bring me a book before this or some other remnant of knowledge if what you say is true
465 who is further astray than he who calls upon other than allah those who will never answer him till the day of resurrection who are indeed heedless of their supplication
466 and when mankind are gathered those will become their enemies and disown their worship
467 when our clear verses are recited to them the unbelievers say of the truth that came to them this is clear sorcery
468 or do they say he has forged it say if i have forged it then you have no power to help me against allah he knows what you say it is sufficient that heis the witness between me and you he is the forgiving the most merciful
469 say i am not an innovation among the messengers nor know what will be done with me or you i follow only what is revealed to me i am only a clearwarner
4610 say consider if this koran is from allah and you disbelieve in it and a witness from the children of israel testifies to its like and believes while you areproud indeed allah does not guide the harmdoers
4611 the unbelievers say of the believers had it been any good they would not have believed in it before us and because they are not guided by it they say this is an ancient falsehood
4612 yet before it there was the book of moses which was an authority and a mercy this koran is the book confirming it the other untampered books in thearabic tongue to warn the harmdoers and to give glad tidings to those who do good
4613 those who say our lord is allah and follow the straight path shall have nothing to fear nor shall they sorrow
4614 those they shall be for ever the inhabitants of paradise a recompense for what they did
4615 we have charged the human to be kind to his parents with much pain his mother bore him and with much pain she gave birth to him his bearing andweaning are thirty months when he grows to manhood and attains his fortieth year he says make me so disposed my lord so that i give thanks for the favorswith which you have blessed me my father and mother and that i will do good deeds that will please you and make me righteous and also my descendants to you i repent and i am among those who surrender
4616 such are those from whom we will accept the best of what they have done and whose evil deeds we shall overlook those they are among the inhabitants of paradise true is the promise that has been promised them
4617 but he who says to his father and his mother fie on you do you promise me that i shall be brought forth when entire generations have passed away before me yet they supplicate to allah for help woe to you believe surely the promise of allah is true then he says this is nothing but fairytales of the ancients
4618 such are they against whom the statement is realized concerning the nations of humans and jinn alike that passed away before them they were the losers
4619 each shall have their degrees according to what they have done so that he will recompense them for their works and they shall not be wronged
4620 upon the day when the unbelievers are brought before the fire we shall say to them you squandered your good things in your earthly life and took your fill of enjoyment in them therefore today you shall be recompensed with a humiliating punishment because you were unrightfully proud in the earth and for that you were debauchers
4621 remember aads brother who warned his nation in the valley of al ahqaf warners had already preceded and succeeded him saying worship noneexcept allah he said indeed i fear for you the punishment of a dreadful day
4622 have you come to turn us away from our gods they replied if what you say is true then bring down that which you promise us
4623 allah alone has the knowledge he said i am sent to deliver to you the message but i can see that you are ignorant people
4624 and when they saw it as a sudden cloud heading for their valley they said this is a cloud that will bring us rain rather he replied it is that which you have sought to hasten a wind in which there is a painful punishment
4625 it will destroy everything by the command of its lord and when morning came there was nothing to be seen except their dwellings as such werecompense sinful people
4626 and we had established them in that which we have not established you and we made for them hearing sight and hearts but their hearing sight andhearts did not help them a thing because they disbelieved the signs of allah and what they mocked encompassed them
4627 we destroyed the villages around you and we repeated our signs so that they might return
4628 why did not those who they took other than allah as mediating gods help them indeed they went astray from them such were their lies and what they were forging
4629 remember how we sent to you prophet muhammad a company of jinn who when they came and listened to the koran said to each other be silent then when it was finished they returned to their nation and warned them
4630 our nation they said we have just been listening to a book sent down after moses confirming what came before it and guiding to the truth and to astraight path
4631 our nation answer the caller of allah and believe in him he allah will forgive you some of your sins and protect you from a painful punishment
4632 those who do not answer the caller of allah cannot frustrate allah in the earth nor shall any one protect them other than him those are in clear error
4633 have they not seen that it is allah who created the heavens and the earth and was not wearied by their creation and that he is able to restore the dead tolife yes he has power over all things
4634 on the day when the unbelievers are brought before the fire they shall be asked is this not the truth yes by our lord they will answer he will saythen taste the punishment for you were unbelievers
4635 be patient as the messengers of might were patient and do not hasten it for them on the day when they see what they have been promised it will be as if they did not stay except an hour of a day this koran is a conveyance shall any be destroyed except the nation of evildoers
471 those who disbelieve and bar from the way of allah allah will cause their deeds go astray
472 as for the believers who do good works and believe in what is sent down to muhammad which is the truth from their lord he will acquit them of their sinsand repair their condition
473 this is because the unbelievers follow falsehood while the believers follow the truth from their lord as such allah sets forth for people their examples
474 therefore when you meet the unbelievers smite their necks then when you have killed many of them tie the bonds then either free them by grace orransom until war shall lay down its loads in this way it shall be had allah willed he would have been victorious over them except that he might test you the oneby the means of others as for those who are killed in the way of allah he will not let their works to go astray
475 he will guide them and repair their condition
476 and he will admit them to the paradise he has made known to them
477 believers if you help allah he will help you and strengthen your feet
478 but the unbelievers shall be the destroyed losers he will bring their deeds to nothing
479 that is because they hated what allah has sent down so he annulled their deeds
4710 have they never journeyed through the land and seen what was the end of those who had gone before them allah destroyed them likewise it is for theunbelievers
4711 that is because allah is the guardian of the believers and the unbelievers have no guardian
4712 allah will indeed admit those who believe and do good works into gardens underneath which rivers flow as for the unbelievers they take their fill of pleasure and eat as the cattle eat but the fire shall be their lodging
4713 how many a village mightier than your own village which has expelled you we have destroyed there was none to help them
4714 is he who has clear proof from his lord to be compared to him whose evil deeds are made to seem fair to him so that they followed their desires
4715 the example of the paradise which the cautious have been promised in it there are rivers of unstaling water and rivers of milk that never change in flavor and rivers of wine delectable to the drinkers and rivers of pure filtered honey they shall have therein of every fruit and forgiveness from their lord are they then like he who shall live in the fire for ever and given boiling water to drink that tears his bowels apart
4716 some of them listen to you but no sooner do they leave you they ask those to whom knowledge has been given what did he say just now such are those whom allah has set a seal upon their hearts and who follow their own desires
4717 as for those who were guided he increases their guidance and gives them their protection
4718 are they looking except for the hour to overtake them suddenly its signs have come but how will they be reminded when it has come to them
4719 therefore know that there is no god except allah and ask for forgiveness of your sins and for the believers men and women allah knows your going to and fro and your lodging
4720 the believers ask has a chapter been sent down but when a clear chapter is sent down and fighting is mentioned in it you see those in whose hearts is sickness looking towards you as one who swoons at death
4721 yet obedience and honorable words would be better for them then when the matter is decided if they were true to allah it would be better for them
4722 could it be that if you turn away you might make corruption in the land and break the ties of kinship
4723 such are those whom allah has cursed making them deaf and blinding their eyes
4724 will they not then contemplate on the koran or are there locks upon their hearts
4725 as for those who turn back in their footsteps after the guidance of allah has become clear to them it was satan who tempted them and allah has respited them
4726 that is because they say to those averse to what allah has sent down we shall obey you in some of the matters allah knows their secrets
4727 how shall it be when the angels of death take them and beat them on their face and back
4728 that is because they follow what angers allah and hate his pleasure therefore he has annulled their deeds
4729 or do those who have a disease in their hearts think that allah will not reveal their hatred
4730 if we willed we would show them to you and you would recognize them by their marks but you will surely know them by their twisted speech allahknows your deeds
4731 without doubt we shall test you until we know those who struggle and are patient among you and make clear your news
4732 those who disbelieve and bar from the path of allah and break with the messenger after guidance has been made clear to them shall not hurt allah a thing and he will annul their deeds
4733 believers obey allah and his messenger and never let your labors go in vain
4734 as for those who disbelieve and bar others from the path of allah and then die as unbelievers allah will not forgive them
4735 therefore do not be weakened and call out for peace you shall be the upper ones and allah is with you and will not deprive you of your labors
4736 the life of this world is but play and an amusement if you believe and are cautious he will give you your wage and will not ask for your possessions
4737 if he asked you for them and presses you you would be mean and he would expose your anger
4738 there you are you are called upon to spend in the way of allah some of you are mean yet whoever is mean is mean only to his own soul allah is therich and you are the poor if you turn away he will replace you with another nation and they will not be like you
481 indeed we have opened for you prophet muhammad a clear opening
482 that allah forgives your past and future sins and completes his favor to you and guides you on a straight path
483 and that allah helps you with a mighty help
484 it was he who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers so that they might add belief upon belief to allah belong the armies of the heavens and the earth allah is the knower the wise
485 from his wisdom he admits the believers both men and women into gardens underneath which rivers flow there to live for ever and acquit them of their sins that with allah is a mighty triumph
486 and that he might punish the hypocrites and the idolaters both men and women and those who think evil thoughts of allah an evil turn of fortune will befall them the wrath of allah is on them and he has cursed them and prepared for them gehenna hell an evil arrival
487 to allah belong the armies of the heavens and the earth allah is the almighty and the wise
488 we have sent you prophet muhammad as a witness and as a bearer of glad tidings and warning
489 so that you believe in allah and his messenger and that you support him revere him prophet muhammad and exalt him allah at the dawn and in theevening
4810 those who swear allegiance to you swear allegiance to allah the hand of allah is above their hands he who breaks his oath breaks it against his self but for he that keeps his covenant made with allah allah shall give him a mighty wage
4811 the bedouins who lagged behind will say to you we were occupied with our possessions and families so ask allah to forgive us but they say with theirtongues what they do not mean in their hearts say who can help you against allah if it is that he wills harm for you or desires benefit for you allah is aware ofwhat you do
4812 no you thought that the messenger and the believers would never return to their families and this was made to seem fair in your hearts so you harbored evil thoughts and so you are a destroyed nation
4813 but whosoever disbelieves in allah and his messenger we have prepared a blazing fire for the unbelievers
4814 to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth he forgives whom he will and punishes whom he will allah is forgiving and merciful
4815 when you set forth to take the spoils those bedouins who lagged behind will say let us follow you they hope to change the words of allah say youshall not follow us allah has said so before they will reply no you are envious of us rather they have only understood a little
4816 say to the arabs who lagged behind you shall be called upon to fight a mighty nation unless they embrace islam if you are obedient you shall receive agood wage from allah but if you turn away as you turned your backs before he will punish you with a painful punishment
4817 there is no fault in the blind or the lame or the sick he who obeys allah and his messenger he shall admit him to gardens underneath which rivers flow but he who turns away shall be punished with a painful punishment
4818 allah was pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you under the tree and he knew what was in their hearts therefore he sent downtranquility upon them and rewarded them with a victory close by
4819 and they took many spoils and allah is the almighty and the wise
4820 allah has promised that you take many spoils he has hastened this to you and restrained the hands of people from you so that he makes it a sign to the believers and to guide you on a straight path
4821 and there were other spoils which you were unable to take allah has encompassed it already allah is powerful over all things
4822 if the unbelievers had fought you they would have been put to flight and found none to protect or help them
4823 such is the way of allah in days gone by and you shall find no change in the ways of allah
4824 it was he who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the hollow hudaibiah of mecca after he had given you victory over them allah sees the things you do
4825 they are those who disbelieved and barred you from the holy mosque and the offering detained so as not to reach its place of sacrifice if it had not been for certain believing men and certain believing women whom you did not know you might have trampled upon them and so sin reached you because of killing them while you did not know in order that allah admits into his mercy whom he will had they the believers been easy to distinguish we would have punished the unbelievers among them with a painful punishment
4826 and when the unbelievers established in their hearts fierce bigotry the fierce bigotry of ignorance allah sent down his tranquility on his messenger and the believers and firmly fastened to them the word of taqwa there is no god except allah and muhammad is his messenger as it is the cause of righteousness to which they have better right and are worthy of it allah has knowledge of all things
4827 indeed allah in truth has realized his messengers vision you shall enter the sacred mosque in security if allah wills with hair shaven or cut short and without fear he knew what you did not know and granted you a near victory
4828 it is he who has sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth so that he exalts it above all other religions allah is the sufficient witness
4829 muhammad is the messenger of allah those who are with him are harsh against the unbelievers but merciful to one another you see them bow andprostrate themselves seeking the bounty and pleasure of allah their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration that is their likeness in the torah and their likeness in the gospel as the seed which puts forth its shoot and strengthens it so that it grows stout and rises straight upon its stalk delighting the sowers and through them he enrages the unbelievers allah has promised those of them who believe and do good deeds forgiveness and a great wage
491 believers do not advance before allah and his messenger fear allah allah is the hearer the knower
492 believers do not raise your voices above the voice of the prophet nor speak loudly to him as you do to one another lest your works should be annulledwithout your knowledge
493 those who lower their voice in the presence of the messenger of allah are those whose hearts allah has tested for warding off evil they shall receiveforgiveness and a great wage
494 whereas those who call out to you from behind the apartments most of them lack understanding
495 if they had patience until you went out to them it would have been better for them but allah is the forgiving and the most merciful
496 believers if an evildoer brings you a piece of news inquire first in case you should unwittingly wrong others and then repent of what you have done
497 know that the messenger of allah is among you if he were to obey you in many matters you would surely suffer but allah has endeared the belief to youand beautified it in your hearts and has made detestable to you disbelief wrongdoing and disobedience such are those who are righteous
498 by the favor and blessing of allah allah is the knower and the wise
499 if two parties of believers fight reform between them if either of them is insolent against the other fight the insolent one till they revert to the order of allah if they revert reform between them with justice and weigh with justice allah loves those who weigh with justice
4910 believers are indeed brothers therefore make things right among your two brothers and fear allah so that you will be subject to mercy
4911 believers do not let people mock other people who may be better than themselves do not let women mock women who may be better than themselves do not find fault with one another nor abuse one another with nicknames an evil name is disobedience after belief those who do not repent are the harmdoers
4912 believers abstain from most suspicion some suspicion is a sin neither spy nor backbite one another would any of you like to eat the flesh of his deadbrother surely you would loathe it fear allah without doubt allah turns in mercy and he is the merciful
4913 people we have created you from a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that you might know one another the noblest of you before allah is the most righteous of you allah is the knower the aware
4914 the arabs declare we believe say you do not rather say we submit because belief has not yet found its way into your hearts if you obey allah and his messenger he will not reduce a thing from of your deeds allah is the forgiving and the most merciful
4915 the believers are those who believe in allah and his messenger and have not doubted and who struggled in his way with their possessions and themselves such are those who are truthful
4916 say would you teach allah what your religion is when allah knows all that is in the heavens and the earth allah has knowledge of all things
4917 they regard it as a favor to you that they have submitted say do not regard your submission as a favor to me rather it is allah who bestows upon you a favor by guiding you to belief if you are truthful
4918 indeed allah knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth and allah is the seer of what you do
501 qaaf by the glorious koran
502 no but they marvel that from among themselves a warner has come to them the unbelievers say in mockery this is a marvelous thing
503 what when we are dead and turned to dust that indeed would be an unlikely return
504 we know all that the earth takes away of them and a book of records is with us
505 rather they belied the truth when it came to them and now they are in a state of confusion
506 what have they never observed the heaven above them and seen how we built and adorned it leaving no crack
507 we spread out the earth and set upon it firm mountains and we cause every delightful thing to grow in it
508 as a lesson and a reminder to every penitent worshiper
509 we sent down blessed water from the sky with which we caused gardens and the grains of harvest to grow
5010 and tall palmtrees with compact spathes
5011 as a provision for the worshipers thereby we revived a land that was dead such shall be the emerging
5012 before them the nation of noah the nation of arrass belied and so did thamood
5013 and aad pharaoh and the brothers of lot
5014 the dwellers of the thicket and the nation of tubba all belied their messengers therefore my threat was realized
5015 what were we wearied by the first creation no indeed yet they are in doubt about a new creation
5016 indeed we created the human we know the whisperings of his soul and are closer to him than the jugular vein
5017 when both receivers the angels receive one on his right the other on his left
5018 whatever phrase he utters an observer is present
5019 and when the agony of death comes in truth they will say this is what you have been trying to avoid
5020 and the horn shall be blown that is the day of threat
5021 each soul shall come with a driver and a witness
5022 it will be said of this you have been heedless therefore we have now removed your covering today your sight is sharp
5023 and his companion will say this is that which i have present
5024 it will be said indeed cast into gehenna hell every deviating unbeliever
5025 forbidder of good transgressor and doubter
5026 who has set up with allah another god indeed you two cast him into the terrible punishment
5027 and his companion shall say our lord i did not make him insolent he was far astray
5028 he allah will say do not dispute before me i sent you a warning beforehand
5029 the word cannot be changed with me i do not wrong my worshipers
5030 on that day we shall ask gehenna are you full and it will answer are there any more
5031 and paradise which is not far away shall be brought closer to those who were cautious
5032 it shall be said to them this is that you were promised it is for every heeding penitent
5033 whosoever fears the merciful in the unseen and comes with a contrite heart
5034 enter it in peace this is the day of eternity
5035 there they have all that they desire and with us is much more
5036 how many generations stronger in might than they have we destroyed before them they searched the land could they find any asylum
5037 surely in this there is a reminder for he who has a heart or listens attentively while witnessing
5038 in six days we created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and no weariness touched us
5039 bear then with patience what they say exalt with the praise of your lord before sunrise and before sunset
5040 and exalt him in the night and at the ends of the prostrations
5041 listen for the day when the caller will call from a nearby place
5042 on the day when they will hear the shout in truth that day they will emerge
5043 it is we who give life and make to die to us is the arrival
5044 upon that day the earth will be rent asunder from around them as they hurry forth that is an easy gathering for us
5045 indeed we know what they say you prophet muhammad are not a tyrant over them therefore remind by the koran whosoever fears my threat
511 by the scatterers the wind scattering
512 then the bearers of weight the clouds
513 then the easy runners the ships
514 then by the distributors angels ordered
515 indeed that which you are promised is true
516 and the recompense shall surely happen
517 by the heaven with its passages
518 surely you are in different sayings
519 and are turned away from him who is turned
5110 woe to the liars
5111 who are heedless in the immersion
5112 when will the day of judgement be they ask
5113 on that day they shall be tried at the fire
5114 taste your trial this is what you have sought to hasten
5115 the righteous shall live among gardens and fountains
5116 receiving what their lord will give them because before this they were gooddoers
5117 they slept but a little at night
5118 and at dawn would ask forgiveness
5119 and in their wealth was a share for whosoever asked and for whosoever was prevented
5120 for those with sure belief there are signs in the earth
5121 and also in yourselves can you not see
5122 in the sky is your provision and that which you are promised
5123 so by the lord of heaven and earth it is as true as your speech
5124 have you heard the story of abrahams honored guests
5125 they entered to him and said peace and he replied peace you are people unknown to me
5126 so he turned to his household and brought a fattened calf
5127 he set it before them saying will you not eat
5128 then he conceived a fear about them and they said have no fear and gave him the glad tidings that he was to have a knowledgeable son
5129 sarah his wife came with an exclamation and clasped her face and said surely i am a barren old woman
5130 such says your lord they replied he is the wise the knower
5131 messengers said he abraham what is your errand
5132 they replied we are sent to a sinful nation
5133 so that we bring down stones of clay upon them
5134 marked by your lord for the sinful
5135 so we brought the believers out of that they were in
5136 but we found in it only one household of those who had surrendered themselves
5137 and left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
5138 in moses too there were signs we sent him to pharaoh with clear authority
5139 but he turned his back with his assembly saying he is either a sorcerer or a mad man
5140 so we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea indeed he was blameworthy
5141 and in aad we let loose on them a withering wind
5142 that left nothing it came upon except that it was ashes
5143 and in thamood it was said to them take your enjoyment for awhile
5144 but in their pride they turn away from the commandment of their lord and the thunderbolt struck them whilst they were looking
5145 they could neither stand up straight nor were they helped
5146 and before them the nation of noah indeed they were a debauched nation
5147 we built the heaven with might and we widely extended it
5148 and we cradled the earth and we are the best of cradlers
5149 we created two kinds of all things so that you will remember
5150 therefore flee to allah i am a clear warner to you from him
5151 do not set up with allah another god i am a clear warner to you from him
5152 similarly no messenger came to those before them but they said sorcerer or mad
5153 have they handed this down from one to another no rather they are an insolent nation
5154 so turn away from them you shall not be blamed
5155 but remind the reminder will benefit the believers
5156 i have not created mankind and jinn except to worship me
5157 i do not desire provision from them nor do i desire that they should feed me
5158 surely allah is the provider the possessor of power the mighty
5159 the evildoers shall have for their portion a portion like their companions who were destroyed before them therefore they should not ask us to hasten
5160 woe then to the unbelievers for their day which they were promised
521 by the mount
522 and by the book in lines
523 in an exposed parchment
524 by the visited house
525 and the uplifted roof
526 and the sea that is full
527 surely the punishment of your lord is about to come
528 there is none to prevent it
529 upon the day when the heaven spins dizzily
5210 and the mountains move moving
5211 on that day woe to those who belied
5212 those who are in plunging playing
5213 on that day when they shall be pitched into the fire of gehenna hell
5214 it will be said to them this is the fire which you belied
5215 is this magic or is it that you do you not see
5216 roast in it bear it with or without patience it is the same you are only being recompensed for that which you used to do
5217 but in the gardens the righteous shall live in bliss
5218 rejoicing in all their lord has given them and their lord will guard them against the punishment of hell
5219 it will be said eat and drink with a good appetite because of that which you did
5220 they shall be reclining on couches ranged in rows and we shall wed them to houris virgins of paradise with large wide eyes
5221 those who believe and whose descendants follow in belief we will join their descendants to them and we will not reduce them of anything of their deeds every one is pledged for what he has earned
5222 we shall give them fruits and meat as they desire
5223 there they will pass a goblet to one another with neither idle talk nor sin
5224 and youths of their own shall pass among them as if they were hidden pearls
5225 they will go to one another asking each other questions
5226 when we were among our people they will say we were ever fearful
5227 but allah has been gracious to us and has protected us from the punishment of the burning wind
5228 before we were supplicating to him he is the giving the most merciful
5229 therefore remind by the favor of allah you are neither a soothsayer nor mad
5230 or do they say he is a poet we are waiting for some misfortune to befall him
5231 say wait if you will i shall be waiting with you
5232 or do their intellects order them to do this or are they an insolent people
5233 do they say he has invented it no they do not believe
5234 let them produce a phrase like it if what they say is true
5235 or were they created out of nothing or were they their own creators
5236 or did they create the heavens and the earth no their belief is not certain
5237 or are the treasures of your lord in their keeping or are they the controllers
5238 or do they have a ladder on which they listen then let any of them that has listened bring a clear authority
5239 or has he daughters and they sons
5240 or do you ask them for a wage so that they become weighed down in debt
5241 or is the unseen in their keeping so they are writing it down
5242 or do they desire to outwit the unbelievers are the outwitted
5243 or do they have a god other than allah exaltations to allah above that which they associate
5244 even if they saw lumps falling from the sky they would say a massed cloud
5245 so leave them till they encounter their day in which they shall be thunderstruck
5246 the day when their guile shall not relieve them a thing and they shall not be helped
5247 for the harmdoers there is indeed a punishment before that but most of them do not know
5248 and be patient under the judgement of your lord surely you are before our eyes and exalt with the praise of your lord when you arise
5249 and exalt him in the night and at the declining of the stars
531 by the star when it plunges
532 your companion is neither astray neither errs
533 nor does he speak out of desire
534 indeed it is not except a revelation which is revealed
535 taught by one who is stern in power
536 of might he gabriel stood firm
537 while he was in the highest horizon
538 then he drew near and became close
539 he was but two bows length or even nearer
5310 so allah revealed to his worshiper gabriel that which he revealed to prophet muhammad
5311 his heart did not lie of what he saw
5312 what will you dispute with him about what he sees
5313 indeed he saw him in another descent
5314 at the lote tree sidrat tree of the ending
5315 close to the garden of refuge
5316 when there comes to the lote tree that which comes
5317 his eyes did not swerve nor did they stray
5318 for indeed he saw one of the greatest signs of his lord
5319 among the idols have you considered allat and aluzza
5320 and another the third manat
5321 what have you males and he females
5322 that is indeed an unjust division
5323 they are but names named by you and your fathers allah has not sent down any authority for them they follow conjecture and their souls desire eventhough the guidance of their lord has come to them
5324 is the human to have whatever he fancies
5325 to allah belongs the eternal life and the first life
5326 how many an angel is there in the heavens whose intercession shall not benefit until allah gives permission to whom he will and is pleased
5327 those who disbelieve in the everlasting life call the angels by female names
5328 yet of this they have no knowledge they follow mere conjecture and conjecture does not help against truth
5329 so turn from those who turn away from our remembrance and only desire this present life
5330 that is all they have of knowledge your lord knows best who has strayed from his path and those who are guided
5331 to allah belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth he will recompense the evildoers according to their deeds and recompense those who have done good with the finest reward
5332 those who avoid the major sin and indecencies except the small sins indeed your lord is of immense forgiveness and he is more knowledgeable of you when he created you from the earth and when you were still unborn in your mothers wombs do not praise yourself allah knows the cautious
5333 have you considered he who turns his back
5334 and gives a little grudgingly
5335 or does he possess knowledge of the unseen and can therefore see
5336 or has he not been told of that which is in the scrolls of moses
5337 and abraham who paid his debt in full
5338 that no soul shall bear anothers burden
5339 and that everyone shall have in his account only that which he worked for
5340 and that his work is surely seen
5341 then he shall be recompensed for it in full repayment
5342 and that the final return is to your lord
5343 that it is he who causes to laugh and causes to weep
5344 and that it is he who causes to die and causes to live
5345 and that it is he who created pairs the male and the female
5346 from an ejaculated drop of sperm
5347 and that upon him is the second creation
5348 and that it is he who gives riches and causes to hoard
5349 and that he is the lord of the star sirius
5350 that it was he that destroyed ancient aad
5351 and thamood sparing no one
5352 and before them the nation of noah they exceeded in evil and were insolent
5353 he plunged the villages
5354 so that there came upon them that which came
5355 so which then of your lords favors do you dispute
5356 this is a warner from the warners of ancient times
5357 the imminent is near at hand
5358 none except allah can disclose it
5359 do you marvel then at this discourse the koran
5360 or do you laugh and do you not weep
5361 while you are thoughtless
5362 rather prostrate to allah and worship him
541 the hour is drawing near and the moon is split in two
542 yet if they see a sign the unbelievers turn their backs and say this is but a continuation of sorcery
543 they have belied and follow their own fancies but every issue will be settled
544 tidings containing a deterrent have come to them
545 which are full of wisdom but the warnings do not help
546 therefore turn away from them on the day when the caller summons them to a terrible thing
547 their eyes will be humbled as they come out from their graves as if they were scattered locusts
548 running with their necks extended to the caller the unbelievers will say this is indeed a harsh day
549 long before them the nation of noah belied they belied our worshiper saying mad and he was reprimanded
5410 then he supplicated to his lord saying i am overcome help me
5411 we opened the gates of heaven with torrential water
5412 and caused the earth to gush with springs so that the waters met for a predestined matter
5413 we carried him in a well built watertight vessel made from planks of wood
5414 that ran on under our eyes a recompense for him because he had been disbelieved
5415 we have left it as a sign is there any that will remember
5416 how then were my punishment and my warnings
5417 we have made the koran easy to remember is there any that will remember
5418 aad too belied how then were my punishment and my warnings
5419 and we sent against them a howling wind in a day of continuous of ill fortune
5420 and snatched people up as though they were stumps of uprooted palmtrees
5421 how then were my punishment and my warnings
5422 we have made the koran easy to remember is there any that will remember
5423 thamood too belied our warnings
5424 they said are we to follow a mortal who is one of us then indeed we would surely be in error and insane
5425 out of all of us has the reminder been given to him alone rather he is indeed an arrogant liar
5426 to him we said tomorrow they shall know who is the arrogant liar
5427 we are sending to them as a trial a shecamel so watch them and have patience
5428 tell them that the water is to be divided between them a drink each for them in turn
5429 but they called their companion who took hold of her and hamstrung her
5430 how then were my punishment and my warnings
5431 then we sent against them one shout and they became like the trampled twigs of the sheep penbuilder
5432 we have made the koran an easy remembrance is there any that will remember
5433 the nation of lot belied our warnings
5434 we let loose on all of them a squall of claystones except for the house of lot whom we saved at dawn
5435 through our mercy so it is that we recompense the thankful
5436 he had warned them of our assault but they disputed the warnings
5437 they even solicited of him his guests but we obliterated their eyes now taste my punishment and my warnings
5438 and at daybreak a determined punishment came upon them
5439 now taste my punishment and my warnings
5440 we have made the koran an easy remembrance is there any that will remember
5441 the warnings also came to pharaohs people
5442 but they belied all our signs so we seized them with the seizing of the mighty powerful
5443 what then are your unbelievers better than those or do you have an immunity written in the scrolls
5444 or do they say we are a gathering that will be victorious
5445 most certainly their gatherings shall be routed and they will turn their backs
5446 rather the hour is their encounter and that hour will be most calamitous and bitter
5447 indeed the wrongdoers are in error and a raging fire
5448 on the day when they are dragged on their faces into the fire it will be said to them taste the touch of the scorching
5449 indeed we have created all things according to a measure
5450 and our order is but one word like the flashing of an eye
5451 and we destroyed those like you is there any that will remember
5452 all their deeds are in the scrolls
5453 everything be it great or small is recorded
5454 indeed the cautious shall live amid gardens and a river
5455 in a secure abode in the presence of the powerful king
551 the merciful
552 has taught the koran
553 he created the human
554 and taught him its pronunciation
555 the sun and the moon to a reckoning
556 the stars and the trees prostrate themselves
557 he raised the heaven on high and set the scale
558 do not transgress the scales
559 give just weight and do not skimp the scales
5510 he set down the earth for the creation
5511 therein are fruits and palm trees with sheaths
5512 the grain in the blade and aromatic herbs
5513 which favors of your lord will you both humans and jinn belie
5514 he created the human from clay like earthenware
5515 and he created the jinn from smokeless fire
5516 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5517 the lord of the two easts the lord of the two wests
5518 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5519 he has let forth the two seas they meet together
5520 and between them is a barrier which they do not overpass
5521 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5522 pearls and corals come from both
5523 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5524 also his are the ships that run raised up like mountains upon the sea
5525 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5526 all that live on it will perish
5527 yet the face of your lord will abide forever majestic and splendid
5528 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5529 whosoever is in the heaven and earth ask him every day he is upon an affair he reveals according to his eternal determination
5530 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5531 we shall surely aim o both burdened
5532 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5533 tribe of jinn and of human if you are able to penetrate the provinces of heaven and earth pass through them but you shall not pass through except with a power
5534 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5535 flames of fire and molten copper shall be loosed against you and you shall not be helped
5536 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5537 when the heaven splits asunder and turns crimson like red leather
5538 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5539 on that day neither human nor jinn shall be asked about his sin
5540 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5541 the sinners shall be known by their mark they shall be seized by their forelocks and their feet
5542 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5543 this is gehenna hell which the sinners belied
5544 they shall go round between it and between a hot boiling water
5545 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5546 and for he who fears the standing before his lord there are two gardens
5547 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5548 gardens with many branches
5549 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5550 therein are two running fountains
5551 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5552 therein are two kinds of every fruit
5553 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5554 they shall recline on couches lined with brocade and the fruits of the gardens will be near at hand
5555 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5556 therein are maidens who restrain their glances whom neither human nor jinn have touched before
5557 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5558 as lovely as rubies and as beautiful as coral
5559 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5560 shall the recompense of goodness be anything other than goodness
5561 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5562 and beside these there shall be two gardens
5563 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5564 the greenest of green pastures
5565 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5566 therein are two gushing fountains of water
5567 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5568 in them are fruits palm trees and pomegranates
5569 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5570 in them shall be good and pleasing
5571 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5572 maidens of paradise houris in cloistered cool pavilions
5573 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5574 neither human nor jinn will have touched them before
5575 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5576 reclining on green cushions and fine carpets
5577 which favors of your lord will you both belie
5578 blessed be the name of your lord majestic splendid
561 when the event the resurrection comes
562 there is no denying its coming
563 it will abase some and exalt others
564 when the earth is shaken
565 and the mountains fragmented
566 becoming scattered dust
567 you shall be divided into three parties
568 companions of the right what are the companions of the right
569 companions of the left what are the companions of the left
5610 and the outstrippers the outstrippers
5611 those are they brought near to their lord
5612 in the gardens of delight
5613 a host of the ancients
5614 but only a few from the later generations
5615 on lavish couches
5616 they shall recline facing each other
5617 and there shall wait on them immortal youths
5618 with goblets and ewers and a cup from a spring
5619 that will neither make the head throb nor intoxicate
5620 with fruits of their own choice
5621 and any flesh of fowl that they desire
5622 and wideeyed houris
5623 like hidden pearls
5624 a recompense for all that they did
5625 there they shall hear no idle talk no cause of sin
5626 but only the saying peace peace
5627 the companions of the right
5628 will be among thornless lote trees
5629 bananatrees piled
5630 and continuous shade
5631 and flowing water
5632 and an abundance of fruits
5633 unfailing and not forbidden
5634 and couches raised up
5635 indeed we formed them the houris and all believing women
5636 and made them virgins
5637 chaste loving companions of the same age
5638 for the companions of the right
5639 a multitude of the ancients
5640 and a multitude of the later people
5641 as for the companions of the left
5642 they shall live amid burning winds and boiling water
5643 in the shadow of a smoking blaze
5644 neither cool nor good
5645 before they lived at ease
5646 and persisted in the great sin
5647 and constantly said what when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we then be restored to life
5648 what and our fathers the ancients
5649 say those of ancient times and those of later times
5650 shall be gathered together to the appointed time on a known day
5651 then you went astray you that belied
5652 you shall eat the fruit of the tree of zakkum
5653 you shall fill your bellies with it
5654 and drink boiling water on top of that
5655 and you will drink as the lapping of thirsty camels
5656 such shall be your hospitality on the day of recompense
5657 we created you why will you not believe
5658 have you thought about what sperm you ejaculate
5659 did you create it or are we the creator
5660 it was we who decreed death among you we will not be surpassed
5661 that we will change you and cause you to grow again in a way you do not know
5662 you have surely known of the first creation why then will you not remember
5663 ponder upon the soil you till
5664 is it you that sow it or are we the sower
5665 if we will we would make it broken stubble and you would remain wondering
5666 saying we are laden with debts
5667 rather we have been prevented
5668 have you thought about the water you drink
5669 is it you that send it down from the clouds or we
5670 if we will we would make it bitter why then do you not give thanks
5671 have you thought about the fire you kindle
5672 is it you that originated its tree or are we the originator
5673 we have made it a reminder and a blessing to the traveler
5674 then exalt the name of your lord the great
5675 i swear by the fallings of the stars
5676 and that is a mighty oath if you but knew
5677 it is indeed a glorious koran
5678 in a book protected from tampering
5679 which none shall touch except the purified
5680 a sending down from the lord of all the worlds
5681 what do you hold this discourse in disdain
5682 do you make it your provision to belie it
5683 why then when the soul leaps up to the throat of the dying
5684 and you are watching at that time
5685 we are nearer to him than you but you do not see
5686 why then if you are not revived
5687 do you not restore his soul if you are truthful
5688 if he is among the near
5689 there shall be calmness and ease a garden of delight
5690 if he is a companion of the right
5691 he will be greeted with peace be upon you companion of the right
5692 but if he is of those who belied and went astray
5693 there shall be a hospitality of boiling water
5694 and a roasting in hell
5695 indeed this is the certain truth
5696 so exalt the name of your lord the great
571 all that is in the heavens and earth exalt allah he is the almighty the wise
572 to him belongs the kingdom in the heavens and earth it is he who revives and causes to die and he has power over all things
573 he is the first and the last the clear and the hidden he has knowledge of all things
574 he created the heavens and the earth in six days and willed to the throne he knows what penetrates the earth and all that emerges from it all that descends from heaven and all that ascends to it he is with you wherever you are allah sees the things you do
575 to him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth to him all matters shall return
576 he causes the night to enter into the day and the day to enter into the night he has knowledge of the thoughts of the innermost of the chests
577 believe in allah and his messenger and spend in charity of that which he has made you successors whosoever of you believes and spends shall have amighty wage
578 why is it that you do not believe in allah when the messenger calls on you to believe in your lord and he has made a covenant with you if you arebelievers
579 it is he who sends down clear verses to his worshiper so that he brings you out of the darkness into the light indeed allah is the gentle the most merciful to you
5710 and why is it that you do not spend in the way of allah when the inheritance of the heavens and earth belong to allah alone those who spent before the victory and took part in the fighting are mightier in rank and are not equal to those who spent and fought thereafter yet allah has promised each a fine reward and allah is aware of what you do
5711 who will lend a generous loan to allah he will multiply it for him and he shall receive a generous wage
5712 the day will surely come when you shall see believing men and women with their light running before them on their right hands it will be said to themglad tidings for you this day you shall live for ever in gardens underneath which rivers flow that is indeed the mighty triumph
5713 on that day the hypocrites both men and women will say to the believers wait for us so that we can take from your light but they will be answered go back and seek a light and a wall with a door shall be between them inside it there is mercy and outside will be the punishment
5714 they will call out to them saying were we not with you yes they will reply but you tempted yourselves you waited for problems to befall thebelievers and you doubted and were deluded by your own fancies until the command of allah came and the deluder satan deluded you concerning allah
5715 today no ransom shall be accepted from you or from the unbelievers your shelter is the fire that is your sponsor the worst arrival
5716 is it not time that the hearts of the believers be humbled to the remembrance of allah and the truth which he has sent down they should not be like those who were given the book before this whose time became very long so that their hearts became hardened many of them were impious
5717 know that allah revives the earth after it was dead we have made plain to you the signs in order that you understand
5718 indeed those who give in charity be they men or women and those who lend a good loan to allah shall be repaid in multiples they shall receive agenerous wage
5719 those who believe in allah and his messengers are the sincere and the martyrs before their lord they shall have their reward and their light but those that disbelieve and belied our verses are the inhabitants of gehenna hell
5720 know that the life of this world is but play and an amusement and adornment and a cause for boasting among you a rivalry for greater riches and children it is like rain whose vegetation pleases the unbelievers but then it withers and turns yellow becoming broken stubble in the everlasting life is a terrible punishment forgiveness and great pleasure from allah the life of this world is nothing except the joy of delusion
5721 therefore race for forgiveness from your lord and for a garden as wide as heaven and earth prepared for those who believe in allah and his messengers such is the favor of allah he gives it to whom he will allah is the owner of great favor
5722 no affliction can befall either the earth or yourself except that it is written in a book before we created it that is easy for allah
5723 so that you will not be saddened for whatever does not come to you nor be overjoyed in what has come to you allah does not love those who are proudand boastful
5724 nor those who are mean and encourage others to be mean and he that turns away know that allah is rich and praised
5725 we have sent our messengers with proofs and sent them with the book and the scales so that people might establish the scale of justice we have sent down iron in which there is great might and diverse benefit for people so that allah knows those who help him and his messengers in the unseen indeed allah is the strong the almighty
5726 we sent forth noah and abraham and appointed the prophethood and the book to be given to their descendants some were guided but many wereimpious
5727 following them we sent our other messengers and we sent following in their footsteps prophet jesus the son of mary and gave him the gospel and put tenderness and mercy in the hearts of his followers as for monasticism they invented it thereby seeking the pleasure of allah we did not write it for them and they did not observe it as it should be observed we gave to those of them who believed their wage but many of them are impious
5728 believers fear allah and believe in his messenger prophet muhammad he will give you a double portion of his mercy and he will make for you a light inwhich to walk and forgive you allah is the forgiver and the most merciful
5729 so that the people of the book may know that they have no power over any of the favors of allah that the favors are in the hand of allah he gives it towhom he will the favor of allah is the great
581 allah has heard the words of her that reasons with you prophet muhammad concerning her husband and made her complaint to allah allah has heard both of you discussing with one another indeed allah is the hearer the seer
582 those of you who say to their wives be as my mothers back indeed they are not their mothers their mothers are only those who gave birth to them indeed they speak dishonorably and falsely but allah is the pardoning the forgiving
583 those who say to their wives be as my mothers back then retract their words thereafter shall set a person free before they touch each other again by that you are admonished allah is aware of all that you do
584 he who is unable shall fast for two successive months before they touch one another if he is unable to do this let him feed sixty needy people that so that you believe in allah and his messenger such are the bounds of allah there is a painful punishment awaiting the unbelievers
585 those who oppose allah and his messenger shall be frustrated just as those before them were frustrated we have sent down proofs and clear verses and for the unbelievers there is a humiliating punishment
586 on the day when allah will raise them up all together he will inform them of what they did allah has taken count of it although they have forgotten allah is witness to all things
587 have you not seen that allah knows that which is in the heavens and the earth there is no secret talk between three but he is the fourth of them nor between five but he is the sixth of them nor between fewer or more but he is with them wherever they are then on the day of resurrection he will inform them of what they have done surely allah has knowledge of all things
588 have you not seen those who were forbidden to talk in secrecy together they return to that which they are forbidden and talk secretly together in sin andhatred and in disobedience to the messenger then when they come to you they greet you with greetings with which allah does not greet you and they say within themselves why does allah not punish us for what we say gehenna hell suffices them they shall be roasted an evil arrival
589 believers when you talk in secret do not talk together in sin and hatred and disobedience towards the messenger but talk of piety and caution fear allah before whom you shall be gathered
5810 talking together maliciously in secret is from satan so that believers should sorrow yet he can not harm them at all except by the permission of allah in allah let the believers put their trust
5811 believers make room in your sitting places when it is asked of you and allah will make room for you when you are asked to move so move and allahwill raise up in ranks those who believed among you and those who have been given knowledge allah is aware of what you do
5812 believers when you consult with the messenger present before your consultation a free will offering that is best and purest for you but if you lack themeans allah is the forgiver and the most merciful
5813 are you afraid to offer a freewill offering before your consultation but if you do not allah will turn to you again then establish the prayer and pay theobligatory charity and be obedient to allah and his messenger allah is aware of what you do
5814 do you see those who have been guided by a nation that incurred the wrath of allah they belong neither to you nor to them and knowingly they swear to lies
5815 allah has prepared for them a grievous punishment evil indeed is that which they have done
5816 they have taken their oaths as a disguise and bar from the way of allah so a humiliating punishment awaits them
5817 neither their wealth nor their children shall help them a thing against allah they are the inhabitants of the fire and there they shall live for ever
5818 on the day when allah shall raise them all up they will swear to him as they now swear to you thinking that they are upon something indeed they are the liars
5819 satan has mastered them and caused them to forget the remembrance of allah those are satans party and satans party shall assuredly be the losers
5820 those who oppose allah and his messenger shall be among the humiliated
5821 allah has written i will surely be the victor i and my messengers surely allah is the strong the almighty
5822 you shall find no nation believing in allah and the last day loving anyone that opposes allah and his messenger even though they be their fathers theirsons their brothers or their tribe those he has written upon their hearts faith and strengthened them with a spirit from him he will admit them to the gardensunderneath which rivers flow where they shall live for ever allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with him they are the party of allah and the party ofallah are the winners
591 all that is in heavens and earth exalt allah he is the almighty the wise
592 it was he who expelled the unbelievers among the people of the book from their homes into the first exile you did not think that they would go out and they thought their fortresses would protect them from allah but allah came upon them from where they did not expect casting terror into their hearts that their homes were destroyed by their own hands as well as by the hands of the believers therefore take heed you that have eyes
593 had it been that allah had not decreed that they should be dispersed he would have surely punished them in this world and in the everlasting life thepunishment of the fire awaits them
594 because they broke their promise with allah and his messenger and whosoever breaks their promise with allah allah is stern in retribution
595 whatever palmtree you cut down or left standing upon its roots it is by the permission of allah so that he might humiliate the impious
596 and whatever spoils of war allah has given to his messenger from them you hastened on neither horse nor camel against them but allah gives hismessengers authority over whom he will allah is powerful over all things
597 the spoils of war taken from the villagers and given by allah to his messenger belong to allah his messenger and the near kinsmen the orphans the needy and the destitute traveler so that it is not something taken in turns by the rich among you whatever the messenger gives you accept it and whatever he forbids you abstain and fear allah surely allah is stern in retribution
598 a share of the spoils shall also be given to the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their possessions who seek the favor and pleasure of allah and help allah and his messenger these are they that are truthful
599 and those before them who had made their dwelling in the abode the city of madinah and because of their belief love those who have emigrated to them they do not find any envy in their chests for what they have been given and prefer them above themselves even though they themselves have a need whosoever is saved from the greed of his own soul they are the ones who win
5910 those who came after them say forgive us our lord and forgive our brothers who were believers before us do not put in our hearts any spite towards those who believe lord you are the gentle the most merciful
5911 have you not seen the hypocrites they say to their brothers among the people of the book who disbelieve if they expel you we will go with you we willnever obey anyone against you if they fight against you we will certainly help you but allah bears witness that they are without doubt liars
5912 if they are expelled or fought against they will not go with them nor will they will help them indeed if they helped them they would turn their backs andthen they would not be helped
5913 their fear of you in their hearts is greater than their fear of allah that is because they are a people who do not understand
5914 they will never fight against you all together except from fortified villages or from behind walls their courage is great among themselves you think them to be united yet their hearts are not united that is because they are a people who have no sense
5915 just as those who not long before tasted the mischief of their actions there awaits for them a painful punishment
5916 like satan when he said to the human disbelieve then as soon as he disbelieved he said indeed i am innocent of you surely i fear allah the lord of all the worlds
5917 their end shall be that they live for ever in the fire that is the recompense of the harmdoers
5918 believers fear allah let every soul look to what it has forwarded for the future and fear allah for allah is aware of the things you do
5919 do not be like those who have forgotten allah so that he has caused them to forget their souls those they are the evildoers
5920 the inhabitants of the fire and the inhabitants of paradise are not equal the inhabitants of paradise shall be triumphant
5921 had we sent down this koran upon a mountain you would have seen it humble itself and split asunder for fear of allah such are the parables we strike for people so that they will reflect
5922 he is allah there is no god except he he knows the unseen and the visible he is the merciful the most merciful
5923 he is allah there is no god except he he is the king the pure the peace the confirmer the watchful the almighty the compeller the sublime exalted is allah above all that they associate
5924 he is allah the creator the originator the shaper to him belong the most beautiful names all that is in the heavens and earth exalt him he is thealmighty the wise
601 believers do not take my enemy and your enemy for your guides offering them love when they have disbelieved the truth that has come to you who expelthe messenger and yourselves because you believe in allah your lord if you go out to struggle in my way seeking my pleasure but secretly love them i know well what you conceal and what you reveal whosoever of you does this will have gone astray from the right path
602 if they come upon you they will be your enemies and stretch out their hands and tongues to do evil to you they wish that you would disbelieve
603 on the day of resurrection neither your blood relatives nor your children shall be of benefit to you allah will differentiate between you and allah sees thethings you do
604 you have a good example in abraham and those with him they said to their nation we are quit of you and that which you worship other than allah we disbelieve you enmity and hatred has shown itself between us for ever until you believe in allah alone except that abraham said to his father surely i shall supplicate to ask for forgiveness for you although i have no power to do anything for you with allah  our lord in you we have put our trust to you we turn and to you is the arrival
605 our lord do not make us a temptation for the unbelievers and forgive us our lord you are the almighty the wise
606 in those there is a good example for whosoever hopes for allah and the last day whosoever turns away indeed allah is the rich and the praised
607 it may be that allah establishes love between you and those with whom you are at enmity allah is the powerful allah is the forgiving and the most merciful
608 allah does not forbid you to be kind and to act justly to those who have neither made war on your religion nor expelled you from your homes allah loves the just
609 but allah only forbids you to be guided by those who have fought against you in your religions cause and expelled you from your homes or have supportedothers in your expulsion whosoever takes them as guides are harmdoers
6010 believers when believing women come to you as emigrants test them allah best knows their belief if you find them to be believers do not return them to the unbelievers they are not permitted to the unbelievers nor are the unbelievers permitted to them but give back to the unbelievers what they have spent and there is no fault in you to marry such women provided you give them their dowries do not hold on to the ties with unbelieving women ask what you have spent and let them ask what they have spent such is the judgement of allah he judges between you and allah is the knower and the wise
6011 if any of your wives desert you to be with the unbelievers and you retaliate give those whose wives who have deserted the equivalent of what they have spent and fear allah in whom you believe
6012 o prophet when believing women come to you and swear loyalty to you upon the condition that they will not associate anything with allah and will notsteal nor commit adultery nor slay their children nor fabricate slander between their hands and their feet nor disobey you in any honorable thing supplicate to allah for forgiveness for them allah is the forgiving and the most merciful
6013 believers do not take as guides those who have incurred the wrath of allah and who despair of the everlasting life to come like the unbelieversdespaired of the inhabitants of the tombs that they shall be resurrected
611 all that is in the heavens and earth exalt allah he is the almighty the wise
612 believers why do you say what you never do
613 it is most hateful to allah that you should say that which you do not do
614 allah loves those who fight in his way lining up as if they were a stacked building
615 and when moses said to his nation why do you harm me when you know that i am the messenger of allah sent to you but when they swerved away allah caused their hearts to swerve allah never guides impious people
616 and when prophet jesus the son of mary said children of israel i am sent to you by allah to confirm the torah that was before me and to give news of a messenger prophet muhammad who will come after me whose name shall be ahmad yet when he came to them with clear proofs they said this is clearsorcery
617 and who does greater evil than he who forges a lie against allah when he is being called to islam allah does not guide the harmdoing people
618 they seek to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths but allah will complete his light much as the unbelievers dislike it
619 it is he who has sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth so that he raises it above all religions much as the unbelievers dislike it
6110 believers shall i direct you to a commerce that will save you from a painful punishment
6111 you shall believe in allah and his messenger and struggle for his way with your possessions and yourselves that is better for you if you but knew
6112 he will forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow and to fine dwelling places in the gardens of eden that is the mightytriumph
6113 and other things that you love victory from allah and an opening that is near o prophet muhammad give glad tidings to the believers
6114 believers be the helpers of allah when prophet jesus the son of mary said to the disciples who will be my helpers unto allah the disciples repliedwe will be the helpers of allah a party of the children of israel believed and a party disbelieved so we supported those who believed against their enemy and they overcame
621 all that is in heavens and earth exalt allah the king the pure the almighty the wise
622 it is he who has raised among the illiterate arabs a messenger from themselves to recite to them his verses to purify them and to teach them the book and the wisdom though before that they were in clear error
623 together with others who have not as yet joined them he is the almighty the wise
624 such is the favor of allah he gives it to whom he will and allah is of abounding favors
625 the likeness of those who were loaded with the torah but did not carry it is like that of a donkey carrying books evil is the example of the people who have belied the verses of allah allah does not guide the evildoers
626 say o you who are jews if you claim that of all people you alone are the guided by allah then long for death if you are truthful
627 but because of what their hands forwarded they will never long for it allah knows the harmdoers
628 say death from which you flee is sure to reach you then you shall be returned to the knower of the unseen and the visible and he will tell you all that you have done
629 believers when you are called to prayer on the day of the congregation friday hasten to the remembrance of allah and put your trading to oneside that is the best for you if you but knew
6210 then when the prayer has ended disperse in the land and seek the favor of allah and remember allah often so that you prosper
6211 yet when they see some commerce or amusement they flock to it leaving you standing say that which is with allah is better than the amusement and commerce allah is the best of providers
631 when the hypocrites come to you they say we bear witness that you are the messenger of allah allah knows that you prophet muhammad are indeedhis messenger and allah bears witness that the hypocrites are truly liars
632 they have taken their oaths as a cover and barred others from the path of allah evil is what they have done
633 that is because they believed then disbelieved because of this a seal has been set upon their hearts so they are unable to understand
634 when you see them their bodies please you but when they speak and you listen to their sayings they are like proppedup timber every shout they hear they take it to be against them they are the enemy be wary of them allah kills them how perverse they are
635 when it is said to them come the messenger of allah will ask forgiveness for you they turn their heads in pride and you see them go away
636 it is equal for them whether you ask for their forgiveness or you do not ask for their forgiveness allah will not forgive them allah does not guide the evildoers
637 it is they that say spend nothing on those who follow the messenger of allah until they disperse yet to allah belong the treasuries of heavens and the earth but the hypocrites do not understand
638 they say if we return to the city the strong will expel the humiliated but the might belongs to allah and his messenger and the believers but thehypocrites do not know
639 believers do not let either your possessions or your children divert you from the remembrance of allah those who do that shall be the losers
6310 so spend of that with which we have provided you before death comes upon any of you and he then says o my lord if only you would defer me to anear term so that i could give in charity and be among the good doers
6311 but allah will never defer any soul when its term comes allah is aware of what you do
641 all that is in heavens and earth exalt allah his is the kingdom and his the praise he is powerful over all things
642 it is he who created you amongst you is an unbeliever and amongst you is a believer allah sees the things you do
643 he created the heavens and the earth in truth and he shaped you and gave you good shapes to him is the arrival
644 he knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth and he knows all what you conceal and what you reveal allah knows the innermost of the chests
645 have you not heard the news of those before you who disbelieved they tasted the mischief of their action and for them is a painful punishment
646 that is because when their messengers came to them with clear proofs they said shall humans be our guides they disbelieved and turned away but allah was not in need of them allah is the rich and the praised
647 the unbelievers think that they will never be raised up say by my lord yes indeed you shall assuredly be raised up then you shall be told of all that you have done that is easy for allah
648 believe in allah and his messenger and in the light which we have sent down allah is aware of all that you do
649 the day on which he will gather you for the day of gathering that is the day of loss and gain he who believes in allah and does good deeds allah willacquit him of his evil deeds and admit him to gardens underneath which rivers flow where he shall live for ever that is the mighty triumph
6410 as for those who disbelieved and belied our verses they shall be the inhabitants of the fire and shall live therein for ever evil shall be their arrival
6411 no affliction falls except by the permission of allah for those who believe in allah allah will guide his heart allah has knowledge of all things
6412 obey allah and obey the messenger but if you turn away our messengers duty is only to deliver the clear message
6413 allah there is no god except he in allah let the believers put their trust
6414 believers some of your wives and children are enemies so beware of them but if you pardon overlook and forgive them then allah is the forgiving the most merciful
6415 your wealth and children are but a trial and with allah is a mighty wage
6416 therefore fear allah as much as you can and listen obey and spend well for yourselves and whosoever is saved from the greed of his own soul those are the winners
6417 if you lend a good loan to allah he will multiply it for you and will forgive you allah is the thankful the clement
6418 he is the knower of the unseen and the visible the almighty the wise
651 o nation of the prophet if you divorce your wives divorce them after the end of their menstrual cycle count their waiting period and fear allah your lord do not drive them from their homes or let them go away unless they commit a proven immorality such are the bounds set by allah he that exceeds the bounds of allah wrongs himself you do not know perhaps after that allah will bring a new event
652 when they have reached their term either keep them honorably or part from them honorably call two honest men among you to witness and give yourwitnessing before allah whoever believes in allah and the last day is warned to do this whosoever fears allah he will appoint for him a way out
653 and provide for him from where he does not expect allah is sufficient for whosoever puts his trust in him indeed allah brings about whatever he decrees allah has set a measure for all things
654 as for your women who have despaired of further menstruating if you are in doubt then their waiting period is three months as well as those who have not yet menstruated as for those who are pregnant their term shall be the time they deliver their burden allah will ease matters by his order for whosoever fears him
655 such is the command of allah that he has sent down to you whosoever fears allah shall be relieved of his sins and given a mighty wage
656 lodge them in your home according to your means do not harass them so as to make life difficult for them if they are with child spend upon them until they deliver their burden and if they suckle give them their wage and consult together honorably but if you both make difficulties let another woman suckle for him
657 let the rich spend according to his wealth and for he whose provision is little let him spend from what allah has given him allah does not charge a soulexcept with that he has given him surely allah will bring ease after difficulty
658 how many a village has turned in its pride against the order of their lord and his messengers we made it a stern reckoning and punished it with a horrible punishment
659 so it tasted the mischief of its action and the end of its matter was loss
6510 allah has prepared a severe punishment for them so those possessing understanding fear allah believers allah has sent this down for you as a reminder
6511 a messenger reciting to you the verses clear verses of allah so that he may bring forth those who believe and do good deeds from the darkness into thelight whosoever believes in allah and does good deeds he will admit to gardens underneath which rivers flow where they shall live for ever and ever for those allah has made a goodly provision
6512 it is allah who has created the seven heavens and of the earth their like and the command descends between them so that you know allah is powerful over all things and that allah encompasses everything in knowledge
661 o prophet why do you forbid that which allah has made lawful to you do you seek to please your wives allah is the forgiving the most merciful
662 allah has absolved you from your oaths allah is your guardian the knowing the wise
663 the prophet confided a certain matter to one of his wives but thereafter she disclosed it then allah revealed what she had done to him he made part of it known and another part not and when he acquainted her with it she said who has told you this he replied i was told of it by the knower the aware
664 if both of you wives turn to allah in repentance even though your hearts inclined but if you support one another against him know that allah is hisguardian and gabriel and the righteous among the believers and thereafter the angels are his reinforcers
665 it may be that if he divorces you his lord will give him in your place better wives than yourselves women who have surrendered believing obedient penitent worshippers and given to fasting who were previously married and virgins too
666 believers guard yourselves and your families against the fire the fuel of which is people and stones over which there are harsh and stern angels who never disobey allah in that which he orders and do what they are ordered
667 unbelievers make no excuse for yourselves this day you shall be recompensed only according to your deeds
668 believers turn to allah in sincere repentance your lord may acquit you of your sins and admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow on a day whenallah will not degrade the prophet and those who believe with him their light will run before them and on their right hands and they will say our lord completeour light for us and forgive us surely you have power over all things
669 o prophet struggle with the unbelievers and the hypocrites and deal harshly with them gehenna hell shall be their refuge an evil arrival
6610 allah has given as an example for the unbelievers the wife of noah and the wife of lot they were married to two of our righteous worshipers but theybetrayed them it was not for noah and lot to avail them a thing it was said to them both enter the fire with those who shall enter
6611 but to those who believe allah has given as an example pharaohs wife who said my lord build me a house before you in paradise and save me frompharaoh and his work and save me from a harmdoing nation
6612 and mary imrans daughter who guarded her chastity so we breathed into her of our spirit gabriel and she put her trust in the words of her lord andhis books and was among the devout
671 blessed be he in whose hand is the kingdom he is powerful over all things
672 who created death and life that he might examine which of you is best in deeds and he is the almighty the forgiving
673 who created the seven heavens one above the other you cannot see any inconsistency in the creation of the merciful return your gaze do you see anycrack
674 then return your gaze once more and yet again your gaze comes back to you dazzled and tired
675 we have adorned the lower heaven with lamps and we made them a stoning for the satans we have prepared the punishment of the blaze for them
676 and for those who disbelieve in their lord there awaits the punishment of gehenna hell an evil arrival
677 when they are cast into it they shall hear it sighing while it boils
678 nearly bursting apart out of rage every time a host is cast therein its keepers will ask them did no one come to warn you
679 yes indeed they will reply but we belied the warner messenger saying allah has not sent down anything you are but in great error
6710 and they will then say if only we had listened and understood we should not now be among the inhabitants of the blaze
6711 so it is that they confess their sins curse the inhabitants of the blaze
6712 but those who fear their lord in the unseen for them there is forgiveness and a great wage
6713 whether you speak in secret or aloud he knows the innermost of the chests
6714 shall he who has created all things not know he is the subtle the aware
6715 it is he who has made the earth submissive to you walk about in its land and eat of his provision to him is the resurrection
6716 do you feel secure that he who is in the heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up while it shakes
6717 do you feel secure that he who is in the heaven will not loose against you a squall of pebbles then you shall know how was my warning
6718 those who have gone before you also belied their messengers then how was my disapproval
6719 do they not observe the birds above them spreading their wings and folding them none except the merciful holds them surely he sees all things
6720 or who is it that shall be your host to help you other than the merciful indeed the unbelievers are only deluded
6721 or who is it that shall provide for you if he withholds his provision yet they persist in arrogance and aversion
6722 what is he who walks falling upon his face more guided than he who walks upright on a straight path
6723 say it is he who has created you and given to you hearing sight and hearts but little is it that you thank
6724 say it was he who created you dispersing you in the earth and to him you shall be gathered
6725 they ask when will this promise come if you speak truthfully
6726 say the knowledge of that is with allah i am only a clear warner
6727 then when they see it drawing near the faces of the unbelievers will be blackened and it is said this is what you were promised
6728 say what do you think if allah destroys me and those with me or has mercy upon us who then will protect the unbelievers from the painful punishment
6729 say he is the merciful in him we believe and in him we put all our trust indeed you shall soon know who is in clear error
6730 say what do you think if your water should sink into the earth in the morning who then would bring you running water
681 noon by the pen and that the angels write
682 you are not because of the favor of your lord mad
683 indeed there is an unfailing wage for you
684 surely you prophet muhammad are of a great morality
685 you shall see and they will see
686 which of you is the demented
687 indeed your lord knows very well those who strayed from his path and those who are guided
688 therefore do not obey those who belie
689 they wish you would compromise then they would compromise
6810 and do not obey every mean swearer
6811 the backbiter who goes about slandering
6812 those who hinder good the guilty aggressor
6813 the crude of low character
6814 because he has wealth and sons
6815 when our verses are recited to him he says they are but fairytales of the ancients
6816 we shall mark him upon his nose
6817 we have tried them as we tried the owners of the garden who had sworn that in the morning they would reap it
6818 without adding to their swearing allah willing inshaallah
6819 then a visitation from your lord came down upon it while they slept
6820 and in the morning it was if the garden had been reaped
6821 then in the morning they called out to one another saying
6822 come out to your tillage if you want to reap
6823 and so they departed whispering to one another
6824 no needy person shall set foot in it today
6825 and they went out early determined in their resolve
6826 but when they saw it they said we have surely gone astray
6827 no rather we have been prevented
6828 whereupon the best among them said did i not say to you to exalt allah
6829 exaltations to allah our lord they said we were truly harmdoers
6830 and they came blaming one another
6831 they said woe to us truly we were insolent
6832 it may be that our lord will give us better than it in exchange to our lord we humbly turn
6833 such was their punishment but the punishment of the everlasting life is much greater if they but knew
6834 surely the cautious shall have gardens of bliss with their lord
6835 what shall we make those who are submissive like the wrongdoers
6836 what is the matter with you then how do you judge
6837 or have you a book from which you study
6838 surely in it you shall have whatever you choose
6839 or have you an oath from us that stretches to the day of resurrection if so you shall surely have what you judge
6840 ask them which of them will guarantee that
6841 or do they have associates then let them bring their associates if what they say is true
6842 on the day when the leg shall be bared and they are ordered to prostrate themselves they will be unable
6843 their eyes will be humbled and humiliation shall spread over them for they were already ordered to prostrate themselves when they were undiminished
6844 therefore leave me with he who belied this discourse we will draw them on little by little from where they do not know
6845 i shall respite them my stratagem is firm
6846 or do you ask them for a wage so that they are burdened withdebt
6847 or is the unseen with them and they are writing it down
6848 so be patient with the judgement of your lord and do not be like the companion of the whale jonah when he called out choking inwardly
6849 had the favor of his lord not come upon him he would have been blamed cast upon the shore
6850 but his lord had chosen him and he placed him among the righteous
6851 when the unbelievers hear the reminder they nearly strike you down with their glances and say surely he is mad
6852 but it is nothing other than a reminder for all the worlds
691 the resurrection verifier
692 and what is the resurrection verifier
693 what makes you to know what the resurrection verifier is
694 thamood and aad belied the clatterer
695 thamood they were destroyed by the violent shout of gabriel
696 as for aad they were destroyed by a howling violent wind
697 that he subjected upon them for seven nights and eight days consecutively and you might have seen them struck down as if they were the stumps of palm trees that had fallen down
698 can you see any remnant of them now
699 similarly pharaoh and those before him and the ruined villages sinned
6910 and rebelled against their lords messenger so he took them with a stern taking
6911 and when the waters rose high we carried you in the sailing ark
6912 making it a reminder for you for all attentive ears to retain
6913 when a single blow is blown on the horn
6914 when the earth with all its mountains is lifted up and crushed with a single blow
6915 on that day the event occurs
6916 the heaven will be split because on that day it will be frail
6917 the angels will stand on all its sides and on that day eight of them will carry the throne of your lord above them
6918 on that day you shall be exposed and no secret of yours will remain hidden
6919 then he who is given his book in his right hand will say here take and read my book
6920 indeed i knew that i should come to my reckoning
6921 his shall be a pleasing life
6922 in a high garden
6923 its fruits are near
6924 it will be said eat and drink with a good appetite because of what you did in days long passed
6925 but he who is given his book in his left hand will say woe to me would that my book had not been given to me
6926 nor that i knew my reckoning
6927 would that it my death had ended it all
6928 my wealth has not helped me a thing
6929 and my authority has been destroyed
6930 it will be said take him and bind him
6931 roast him in hell
6932 then in a chain seventy arms lengths long insert him
6933 he did not believe in allah the great
6934 nor did he urge the feeding of the needy
6935 today he shall have no loyal friend here
6936 nor any food except foul pus
6937 that none but sinners eat
6938 i swear by all that you can see
6939 and all that you do not see
6940 that this is the speech of a noble messenger
6941 it is not the speech of a poet little do you believe
6942 nor is it the speech of a soothsayer little do you remember
6943 it is a sending down from the lord of all the worlds
6944 had he invented sayings against us
6945 we would have seized him by the right hand
6946 then we would surely have cut from him the aorta vein
6947 not one of you could have prevented it from him
6948 indeed it is a reminder to those who fear allah
6949 we know that there are some among you who will belie
6950 indeed it is a sorrow to the unbelievers
6951 yet it is a certain truth
6952 exalt the name of your lord the great
701 a caller supplicated about a punishment to fall on
702 the unbelievers which none can prevent
703 a punishment from allah the owner of the elevated passages
704 to him the angels and the spirit gabriel ascend in a day the measure of which is fifty thousand years
705 therefore be patient with a beautiful patience
706 they see it as being far off
707 but we see it near
708 on that day the heaven shall become like molten copper
709 and the mountains shall be like puffs of wool
7010 no loyal friend will ask another loyal friend
7011 though they are in sight of each other to ransom himself from the punishment of that day the sinner will wish that he might even ransom himself by his sons
7012 his companion wife his brother
7013 the kinsmen who gave him shelter
7014 and whosoever is in the earth altogether so that it might save him
7015 no in truth it is a furnace
7016 it snatches away by the scalps
7017 and it shall call him who withdrew and turned his back
7018 and amassed riches and hoarded
7019 indeed the human was created grudging and impatient
7020 when evil comes upon him he is impatient
7021 but when good comes upon him he is grudging
7022 except those that pray
7023 who are constant in prayer
7024 who from their wealth is a known right
7025 for the impoverished nonrequester and the requester
7026 who confirm the day of reckoning
7027 and go in fear of the punishment of their lord
7028 for none is secure from the punishment of their lord
7029 who guard their privates
7030 except from their wives and what their right hands own for these they are not blameworthy
7031 but whosoever seeks beyond that they are the transgressors
7032 those who keep their trusts and their covenant
7033 and standby their witnessing
7034 and who are constant in their prayers
7035 those are highly honored in the gardens
7036 but what is the matter with the unbelievers that they strain their glances continuously towards them
7037 on the right and on the left in groups
7038 what is every one of them eager to be admitted to the garden of bliss
7039 not at all for we have created them of what they know
7040 no i swear by the lord of the easts and the wests that we have the ability
7041 to exchange them with others better than they nothing can outstrip us
7042 so leave them alone to plunge and play until they encounter the day which they are promised
7043 the day when they shall rush from their graves as if they were hurrying to a raised flag
7044 their eyes are humbled and they are covered with humiliation such is the day that they were promised
711 we sent noah to his nation saying give warning to your nation before a painful punishment overtakes them
712 he said my nation i am a clear warner for you
713 worship allah fear him and obey me
714 he will forgive you your sins and respite you till an appointed term when the term of allah arrives it cannot be deferred if you but knew
715 my lord said he night and day i have called my nation
716 but my call has only increased them in running away
717 each time i called them so that you might forgive them they thrust their fingers in their ears and wrapped themselves in their garments and persisted becomingvery proud
718 i called to them clearly
719 and indeed i spoke to them both publicly and in secret
7110 ask for forgiveness of your lord i said surely he is the forgiver
7111 he will let loose the sky upon you in abundance
7112 and give to you wealth and sons and provide you with gardens and rivers
7113 what is the matter with you that you do not want the greatness of allah
7114 he has created you by stages
7115 have you not seen how allah created the seven heavens one above the other
7116 setting in them the moon as a light and the sun as a lantern
7117 allah has caused you to grow out of the earth
7118 and to it he will return you then he will bring you forth
7119 allah has made the earth spread out for you
7120 so that you walk in its spacious paths
7121 noah said my lord they have rebelled against me and followed he whose wealth and offspring increase him only in loss
7122 they have devised a mighty plot
7123 and said do not renounce your gods do not leave waddan or suwaan or yaghutha or yauqa or nasra
7124 and they have led many astray noah supplicated saying allah do not increase the harmdoers except in error
7125 so because of their sins they were drowned and admitted into the fire they found none to help them other than allah
7126 and noah supplicated saying my lord do not leave a single unbeliever upon the earth
7127 surely if you leave them they will mislead your worshipers and father none but the immoral and unbelievers
7128 forgive me my lord and my parents and whosoever seeks refuge in my house as a believer and the believers men and women alike and do not increase the harmdoers except in ruin
721 say it is revealed to me that a party of jinn listened then said we have indeed heard a wonderful koran
722 that guides to the right path we believe in it and we will not associate anyone with our lord
723 he exalted be the majesty of our lord who has neither taken to himself a wife nor a son
724 the ignorant fool among us has spoken outrageously against allah
725 we never thought that either human or jinn would ever tell a lie against allah
726 but there were certain men from mankind who would take refuge with certain males from the jinn and they increased them in tyranny
727 like you they thought that allah would never raise the dead
728 the jinn continued saying we made our way towards heaven but we found it filled with stern guards and a flame
729 there we would sit to eavesdrop but now an eavesdropper finds a flame in wait for him
7210 and so we do not know whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their lord intends to guide them
7211 some of us are righteous but some are otherwise we are sects that differ
7212 we know that we cannot frustrate allah in the earth nor can we frustrate him by flight
7213 when we heard the guidance we believed in it and whosoever believes in his lord shall fear neither shortage nor injustice
7214 some of us have surrendered muslims and some of us have deviated those who surrendered sought the right path
7215 but those who have deviated shall become the fuel of gehenna hell
7216 if they had followed the path we would give to them abundant water to drink
7217 and tested them with it and whosoever turns away from his lords remembrance he will hurl him into a stern punishment
7218 mosques belong to allah so do not call to anyone else other than allah
7219 when the worshiper of allah stood supplicating to him they swarmed around him prophet muhammad
7220 say i supplicate only to my lord and i do not associate any with him
7221 say indeed i possess no power over you either for harm or for guidance
7222 say none shall protect me from allah and other than him i will find no refuge
7223 except a deliverance from allah and his messages he who disobeys allah and his messenger for him is the fire of gehenna which he will be in for ever
7224 when they see that which they were promised they shall know who is weaker in helpers and fewer in numbers
7225 say i do not know whether that which you are promised is near or whether my lord will set for it a time
7226 he is the knower of the unseen and does not disclose his unseen to anyone
7227 except only to a messenger that he has chosen and he sends guardians before him and behind him
7228 so that he may know that they have delivered the messages of their lord and he encompasses all that is with them and he has counted everything innumbers
731 o you prophet muhammad wrapped
732 rise to pray the night except a little
733 half the night or a little less
734 or a little more and with recitation recite the koran
735 we are about to cast upon you a weighty word
736 indeed the first part of night is heavier in tread and more upright in speech
737 you have by day prolonged occupations
738 remember the name of your lord and dedicate yourself devoutly to him
739 he is the lord of the east and the west there is no god except him take him for your guardian
7310 bear patiently with what they say and with a fine abandonment forsake them
7311 leave to me those who belie those who lead a life of pleasure and bear with them yet a little while
7312 we have fetters for them and a blazing fire
7313 choking food and a painful punishment
7314 on the day when the earth with all its mountains quake and the mountains become heaps of shifting sand
7315 indeed we have sent to you a messenger as a witness over you just as we sent a messenger to pharaoh
7316 pharaoh disobeyed our messenger so we seized him remorselessly
7317 if you disbelieve how will you guard yourself against the day that will make children gray haired
7318 on which the heaven will split apart and his promise is done
7319 this is indeed a reminder let whosoever will take the path to his lord
7320 your lord knows that you keep vigil nearly two thirds of the night and sometimes half or onethird of it and a party of those with you allah measures thenight and the day he knows that you cannot count it and turns to you therefore recite from the koran as much as is easy for you he knows that among youthere are the sick and others traveling the road seeking the bounty of allah and others fighting in the way of allah so then recite from it as much as is easy establish your prayers pay the obligatory charity and lend allah a generous loan whatever good you shall forward to your souls account you surely will find it better with allah and a mightier wage and supplicate for the forgiveness of allah allah is the forgiving the merciful
741 o you prophet muhamad the cloaked
742 arise and warn
743 and exalt your lord
744 and purify your clothing
745 and flee from the statues
746 do not give thinking to gain greater
747 be patient unto your lord
748 when the horn is blown
749 that shall be a harsh day
7410 and it will not be easy for the unbelievers
7411 leave me alone with he whom i created
7412 and designated for him ample wealth
7413 and sons that stand in witness
7414 i made things smooth and easy for him
7415 yet he is eager that i increase him
7416 not at all surely he has been disobedient to our verses
7417 i will constrain him to a hard ascent
7418 he reflected and then determined
7419 death seized him how was his determining
7420 again death seized him how was his determining
7421 then he looked
7422 frowned and scowled
7423 then he retreated and grew proud
7424 and said this is no more than traced sorcery
7425 it is nothing but the word of a mortal
7426 i will surely roast him in the scorching
7427 what will let you know what the scorching is like
7428 it neither spares nor releases
7429 and it burns the flesh
7430 over it are nineteen angels guarding
7431 we have appointed none but angels to guard the fire and made their number only as a trial for the unbelievers so that those to whom the book was given are certain and those who believe increase in belief and that those who were given the book and those who believe will not be in doubt and that those in whose hearts there is a sickness together with the unbelievers may say what did allah intend by this as an example as such allah leaves in error whom he will and he guides whomsoever he will none knows the hosts of your lord except he this is no more than a reminder to humans
7432 no by the moon
7433 by the receding night
7434 and the morning when it appears
7435 it is one of the greatest trials
7436 a warning to humans
7437 to whoever among you desires to go forward or lag behind
7438 each soul is held in pledge for what it earns
7439 except the companions of the right
7440 in gardens they will question
7441 concerning the sinners
7442 what caused you to be thrust into the scorching fire
7443 they will reply we were not among those who prayed
7444 and we did not feed the needy
7445 we plunged in with the plungers
7446 and belied the day of recompense
7447 till the certainty death overtook us
7448 the intercession of their intercessors shall not benefit them
7449 what is the matter with them that they turn away from this reminder
7450 like startled wild donkeys
7451 fleeing before a lion
7452 indeed each one of them desires to be given unrolled scrolls
7453 no indeed they have no fear of the everlasting life
7454 no indeed surely this is a reminder
7455 so whoever wills will remember it
7456 but none will remember unless allah wills he is the owner of fear the owner of forgiveness
751 no i swear by the day of resurrection
752 no i swear by the reproachful soul
753 what does the human think we shall never gather his bones
754 indeed yes we are able to shape his fingerstips yet again
755 rather the human desires to continue in his immorality
756 when will the day of resurrection be he asks
757 but when the sight is dazed
758 and the moon eclipsed
759 when the sun and moon are gathered together
7510 on that day the human will ask to which place shall i flee
7511 no there shall be no place of refuge
7512 for on that day the refuge shall be to your lord
7513 on that day the human shall be informed of his former and latter deeds
7514 he shall be a clear proof against himself
7515 even though he offers his excuses
7516 do not move your tongue with it the revelation to hasten it
7517 its gathering and reciting is upon us
7518 when we recite it follow its recitation
7519 its explanation is upon us
7520 yet you love this hasty world
7521 and are heedless of the everlasting life
7522 on that day there shall be radiant faces
7523 gazing towards their lord
7524 and on that day there shall be scowling faces
7525 so they might think the calamity had been inflicted upon them
7526 but when the soul reaches the collar bone
7527 and it is said who is a healing chanter
7528 and when he thinks it is the time of departure
7529 and when leg is intertwined with leg
7530 upon that day the driving shall be to your lord
7531 because he neither believed nor prayed
7532 he belied the truth and turned away
7533 then went arrogantly to his household
7534 near to you and nearer
7535 then nearer to you and nearer
7536 does the human think he will be left to roam at will
7537 what was he not an ejaculated drop of sperm
7538 then he was a clot of blood then he created and formed him
7539 and made from him two kinds male and female
7540 what is he then unable to revive the dead
761 indeed there came upon the human a period of time when he was an unremembered thing
762 we have created the human from a sperm drop a mixture testing him we made him to hear and see
763 indeed we have guided him to the path he is either grateful or ungrateful
764 indeed for the unbelievers we have prepared chains fetters and a blazing fire
765 but the righteous shall drink of a goblet mixed with camphor
766 a fountain at which the worshipers of allah drink and make it gush forth abundantly
767 they who keep their vows and fear a day whose evil is spread
768 who give food for the love of him to the needy the orphan and the captive
769 saying we feed you only desirous of the face of allah we seek of you neither recompense nor thanks
7610 for we fear from our lord a stern frownful day
7611 so allah will save them from the evil of that day and has secured for them radiance and joyfulness
7612 and recompense them for their patience with a garden and robes of silk
7613 reclining there upon couches they shall see neither the sun nor the moon
7614 near them shall be its shades with its clusters hung gently down
7615 and passed around them shall be silver vessels and crystal goblets
7616 goblets of silver that they have precisely measured
7617 and they shall be given to drink from a cup whose mixture is ginger
7618 from a fountain called salsabila
7619 immortal youths will go about them when you see them you would suppose them to be scattered pearls
7620 when you see them you see bliss and a great kingdom
7621 upon them there will be garments of green silk rich brocade and they will be adorned with bracelets of silver their lord will give them a pure beverage to drink
7622 see this is your recompense your striving is thanked
7623 we have indeed sent down to you the koran a clear sending
7624 therefore be patient under the judgement of your lord and do not obey either the sinner or the unbeliever
7625 and remember the name of your lord at the dawn and in the evening
7626 and in the night prostrate to him and exalt him for a long night
7627 indeed these love the hasty life and are heedless and leave behind them a heavy day
7628 we created them and we strengthened their joints but when we will we shall indeed exchange their likes
7629 this is indeed a reminder so that he who will takes a path to his lord
7630 yet you will not unless allah wills surely allah is the knower the wise
7631 he is merciful to whom he will but for the harmdoers he has prepared for them a painful punishment
771 by the wind those sent as horses mane in succession
772 storming tempestuously
773 and by the scatterers scattering rain
774 then the criterion the verses of koran separating
775 and those angels dropping reminding
776 excusing or warning
777 surely that which you have been promised is about to fall
778 when the stars are extinguished
779 and when the sky is rent asunder
7710 and the mountains scattered
7711 and when the messengers time is set
7712 to what day shall they be deferred
7713 upon the day of decision
7714 would that you knew what the day of decision is
7715 woe on that day to those who belied it
7716 did we not destroy the ancients
7717 and let the latter follow them
7718 as such shall we deal with the sinners
7719 woe on that day to those who belied it
7720 did we not create you from a weak water
7721 which we placed within a sure lodging
7722 for an appointed term
7723 we determined how excellent a determiner are we
7724 woe on that day to those who belied it
7725 have we not made the earth a housing
7726 for both the living and the dead
7727 have we not placed high mountains upon it and filled you with sweet water
7728 woe on that day to those who belied it
7729 depart to that which you belied
7730 depart into the shadow of three masses
7731 wherein there is neither shade nor freeing from the blazing flames
7732 it throws spits as high as a huge palace
7733 as black camels
7734 woe on that day to those who belied it
7735 this is the day they shall not speak
7736 nor shall they be given permission so that they can apologize
7737 woe on that day to those who belied it
7738 such is the day of decision we will gather you with the ancients
7739 if you are cunning then try your cunning against me
7740 woe on that day to those who belied it
7741 indeed the cautious shall live amid shades and fountains
7742 and have such fruits as they desire
7743 it shall be said to them eat and drink with a good appetite for all that you did
7744 as such we recompense those who did good
7745 woe on that day to those who belied it
7746 eat and enjoy yourselves a little for you are sinners
7747 woe on that day to those who belied it
7748 when it is said to them bow yourselves they do not bow
7749 woe on that day to those who belied it
7750 after this in what discourse will they believe
781 what do they question each other about
782 about the great news
783 whereupon they are at variance
784 indeed they shall know
785 again indeed they shall know
786 have we not made the earth as a cradle
787 and the mountains as pegs
788 and we created you in pairs
789 and we made your sleep a rest
7810 and we made the night a mantle
7811 and we made the day for a livelihood
7812 and we built above you seven strong ones
7813 and placed in them a blazing lamp
7814 and have sent down from the clouds pouring rain
7815 that we may bring forth with it grain plants
7816 and luxuriant gardens
7817 indeed the day of decision is an appointed time
7818 the day that the horn is blown and you shall come in crowds
7819 and heaven is opened having gates
7820 and the mountains move and vaporize
7821 indeed gehenna hell has become an ambush
7822 a return for the insolent
7823 there they shall live for ages
7824 tasting neither coolness nor any drink
7825 except boiling water and pus
7826 for a suitable recompense
7827 indeed they did not hope for a reckoning
7828 and they absolutely belied our verses
7829 and everything we have numbered in a book
7830 taste we shall not increase you except in punishment
7831 but for the cautious a place of prosperity
7832 and gardens and vineyards
7833 curvaceous virgins of equal age
7834 and an overflowing cup
7835 there they shall neither hear idle talk nor yet any falsehood
7836 a recompense from your lord a gift a reckoning
7837 the lord of the heavens and earth and all that is between them the merciful of whom they are unable to speak
7838 on that day when the spirit gabriel and the angels stand in ranks they shall not speak except he to whom the merciful has given permission and sayswhat is right
7839 that is the day the truth so whosoever wills takes a way to his lord
7840 indeed we have forewarned you of an imminent punishment the day when the person will look upon his works and the unbelievers will say would that i were dust
791 by the pluckers the angels of death violently plucking the souls of the unbelievers
792 by the drawers the angels of death gently drawing the souls of the believers
793 by the swimmers angels swimming gently
794 and the outstrippers angels outstripping
795 by the managers angels affair
796 on the day the shiverer shivers
797 followed by the succeeding
798 hearts will throb on that day
799 and their eyes will be humbled
7910 they say what are we being restored as we were before
7911 even after we are fragmented bones
7912 they will say then we are returned lost
7913 but it will be only a single blow
7914 and they will be upon the surface of the earth alive
7915 have you received the story of moses
7916 his lord called to him in the sacred valley of towa
7917 saying go to pharaoh he has become exceedingly insolent
7918 and say will you purify yourself
7919 that i might guide you to your lord so that you fear him
7920 he showed him the mighty sign
7921 but he belied and disobeyed
7922 and hastily turned away
7923 then he gathered proclaimed then said
7924 i am your lord the most high
7925 so allah seized him with the punishment of the everlasting life and of this world
7926 surely in this there is a lesson for he that fears
7927 what are you harder to create than the heaven which he has built
7928 he raised it high and leveled it
7929 and darkened its night and brought forth its morning
7930 and the earth he extended after that
7931 and then brought from it its water and pastures
7932 and the mountains he set firm
7933 an enjoyment for you and your herds
7934 but when the great catastrophe comes
7935 the day when the human will remember what he has worked for
7936 and when hell is advanced for whoever sees
7937 then as for whosoever was insolent
7938 preferring the present life
7939 surely hell will be their refuge
7940 but whosoever feared the standing before his lord and prevented the self from desires
7941 indeed their refuge shall be paradise
7942 they will question you about the hour when shall it be
7943 but how are you to know
7944 its final end is for your lord
7945 you are but a warner for those who fear it
7946 on the day when they behold it it will be as if they had lingered but an evening or a morning
801 he frowned and turned away
802 when the blind came to him
803 and what could let you know perhaps he comes to hear you to be purified
804 he might remember and the reminder might profit him
805 as for he who is sufficed
806 you attended to him
807 although it is not for you to be concerned if he remained unpurified
808 and to him who came to you eagerly
809 and fearfully
8010 of him you were unmindful
8011 no indeed this is a reminder
8012 and whosoever wills shall remember it
8013 upon highly honored pages
8014 exalted purified
8015 by the hands of scribes
8016 noble and pious
8017 perish the human how unthankful he is
8018 from what did he create him
8019 from a sperm drop he created him and then determined him
8020 then eased his path for him
8021 then causes him to die and buries him
8022 then he will raise him when he wills
8023 indeed he has not fulfilled that which he has ordered him
8024 let the human reflect on the food he eats
8025 how we pour down rain in abundance
8026 and split the earth splitting
8027 how we made the grain to grow
8028 grapes and fresh fodder
8029 and the olive and the palm
8030 the densely treed gardens
8031 and fruit and pastures
8032 for you and for your herds to delight in
8033 but when the blast comes
8034 on that day each person will flee from his brother
8035 his mother and his father
8036 his wife and his children
8037 everyone on that day will have affairs to keep him occupied
8038 some faces will shine
8039 laughing and joyful
8040 whereas some faces will be covered with dust
8041 and veiled with darkness
8042 those they are the unbelievers the immoral
811 when the sun is woundup
812 when the stars are thrown down
813 and the mountains have been taken
814 when the pregnant camels are neglected
815 when the savage beasts are gathered
816 when the seas are set boiling
817 when the souls are coupled to their body
818 when the buried female infant is asked
819 for what crime she was slain
8110 when the scrolls are unrolled
8111 when heaven is stripped
8112 when hell is set ablaze
8113 when paradise is brought near
8114 then each soul shall know what it has produced
8115 rather i swear by the returning
8116 orbiting disappearing
8117 by the night when it approaches
8118 and the morning when it extends
8119 it is indeed the word of an honorable messenger
8120 of power given a rank by the owner of the throne
8121 obeyed and honest
8122 your companion is not mad
8123 in truth he saw him gabriel on the clear horizon
8124 he is not grudging of the unseen
8125 nor is this the word of a stoned satan
8126 where then are you going
8127 this is nothing but a reminder to the worlds
8128 for whosoever of you would go straight
8129 but you shall not unless allah wills the lord of all the worlds
821 when the sky is split
822 when the planets are scattered
823 when the oceans are gushed forth
824 when the graves are overturned
825 the soul shall know what it has done the former and the latter
826 o human what has deceived you concerning your generous lord
827 who created you formed you and proportioned you
828 in whatever shape he will he could surely have fashioned you
829 rather you belied the recompense
8210 yet over you there are watchers
8211 noble scribes
8212 who know of all that you do
8213 indeed the righteous shall live in bliss
8214 but the wicked indeed they shall be in the fiery furnace
8215 roasting in it on the day of recompense
8216 and from it they shall never be absent
8217 what could let you know what the day of recompense is
8218 again what could let you know what the day of recompense is
8219 it is the day when no soul can do a thing for another soul that day the command belongs to allah
831 woe to the diminishers
832 who when people measure for them take full measure
833 but when they measure or weigh for others they reduce
834 do they not think that they will be resurrected
835 for a great day
836 the day when people will stand before the lord of the worlds
837 no indeed the book of the immoral is in sijjeen
838 what could let you know what the sijjeen is
839 it is a marked book
8310 woe on that day to those who belied it
8311 who belied the day of recompense
8312 none belies it except every guilty sinner
8313 when our verses are recited to him he says fictitious tales of the ancients
8314 no indeed their own deeds have cast a veil over their hearts
8315 no indeed on that day they shall be veiled from their lord
8316 then they shall roast in hell
8317 and it will be said to them this is that which you belied
8318 but the book of the righteous is in the illiyoon
8319 what could let you know what the illiyoon is
8320 it is a marked book
8321 witnessed by those who are near to allah
8322 the righteous shall indeed be blissful
8323 reclining upon couches they will gaze
8324 and in their faces you shall know the radiance of bliss
8325 they shall be given to drink of a wine that is sealed
8326 its seal is musk for this let the competitors compete
8327 and its mixture is tasneem
8328 a fountain at which those brought near to their lord drink
8329 the sinners laughed at the believers
8330 and winked at one another as they passed them by
8331 when they returned to their people they returned jesting
8332 and when they saw them said these are they who are astray
8333 yet they were not sent to be their guardians
8334 but on this day the believers will laugh at the unbelievers
8335 as they recline upon their couches and gaze around them
8336 have the unbelievers been rewarded for what they did
841 when the sky is torn apart
842 hearing and obeying its lord as it must do
843 when the earth is stretched out
844 and casts out all that is within and voids itself
845 obeying its lord as it must do
846 o human you are working hard towards your lord and you will meet him
847 then he who is given his book in his right hand
848 shall have an easy reckoning
849 and will return rejoicing to his family
8410 but he who is given his book from behind his back
8411 shall call for destruction
8412 and roast at the blaze
8413 once he lived joyfully among his family
8414 and surely thought he would never return to his lord
8415 yes indeed his lord was ever watching him
8416 i swear by the twilight
8417 by the night and all that it envelops
8418 by the moon in its fullness
8419 that you shall surely ride from stage to stage
8420 what is the matter with them that they do not believe
8421 and when the koran is recited to them that they do not prostrate
8422 no the unbelievers only belie
8423 and allah knows very well what they gather
8424 therefore give to them glad tidings of a painful punishment
8425 except to those who believe and do righteous deeds for theirs is an unfailing recompense
851 by the heaven of the constellations
852 by the promised day
853 by the witness and the witnessed
854 the companions of the pit were killed
855 the fire with its fuel
856 when they were seated around it
857 and they were witnesses of what they did to the believers
858 and their revenge on them was only because they believed in allah the almighty the praised
859 to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and earth and allah is the witness of all things
8510 those who persecuted the believing men and women and never repented there is for them the punishment of gehenna hell and for them the punishment of the burning
8511 but for those who believe and do good works for them there are gardens underneath which rivers flow that is the great victory
8512 indeed the seizing of your lord is severe
8513 it is he who originates and repeats
8514 and he is the forgiving and the loving
8515 owner of the throne the exalted
8516 the doer of whatever he wants
8517 has it come to you the story of the hosts
8518 of pharaoh and of thamood
8519 yet the unbelievers still belie
8520 allah encompasses them all from behind
8521 indeed this is a glorious koran
8522 in a guarded tablet
861 by the sky and by the nightly comer
862 what could let you know what the nightly comer is
863 it is the piercing star
864 for every soul there is a watcher
865 let the human reflect of what he is created
866 he was created from ejaculated water
867 that issues from between the loins and the ribs
868 surely he is able to bring him back
869 on the day when consciences are examined
8610 when he will be helpless with no supporter
8611 by the sky with its returning rain
8612 and by the earth bursting with vegetation
8613 this is indeed a decisive word
8614 it is not a jest
8615 they are cunningly devising
8616 and i am cunningly devising
8617 therefore respite the unbelievers and delay them for a while
871 exalt the name of your lord the highest
872 who has created and shaped
873 who has ordained and guided
874 who brings forth the pastures
875 then made it dry dark flaky stubble
876 we shall make you recite so that you will not forget
877 except what allah wills surely he knows all that is spoken aloud and what is hidden
878 we shall ease you to the easy
879 therefore remind if the reminder benefits
8710 and he who fears shall remember
8711 but the most wretched shall avoid it
8712 who will roast in the great fire
8713 in which he will neither die nor live therein
8714 prosperous is he who purifies himself
8715 and remembers the name of his lord so he prays
8716 but you prefer the present life
8717 but the everlasting life is better and more enduring
8718 surely this is in the ancient scrolls
8719 the scrolls of abraham and moses
881 have you received the news of the enveloper
882 on that day faces shall be humbled
883 laboring wornout
884 roasting at a scorching fire
885 that is fueled from a tremendously hot fountain
886 no food for them except thorny plants
887 which neither sustains nor satisfy hunger
888 whereas other faces on that day will be joyful
889 well pleased with their striving
8810 in a garden on high
8811 where they will hear no idle talk
8812 a gushing fountain shall be there
8813 and raised couches
8814 and prepared goblets
8815 and arranged cushions
8816 and outspread carpets
8817 what do they not reflect upon how the camel was created
8818 and how the heaven was raised up
8819 and how the mountains were firmly fixed
8820 and how the earth was outstretched
8821 therefore remind you are only a reminder
8822 you are not charged to oversee them
8823 as for those who turn their back and disbelieve
8824 allah will punish them with the greatest punishment
8825 indeed to us they shall return
8826 then upon us shall rest their reckoning
891 by the dawn
892 and ten nights of pilgrimage or the last ten days of ramadan
893 by the even and the odd
894 by the night when it journeys on
895 is there in that an oath for the mindful
896 have you not heard how your lord dealt with aad
897 of the columned city of iram
898 the like of which was never created in the countries
899 and thamood who hewed out the rocks of the valley
8910 and pharaoh of the pegs impaling his victims
8911 they were tyrants in the land
8912 and exceeded in corruption therein
8913 therefore your lord let loose upon them a scourge of punishment
8914 indeed your lord is ever watchful
8915 as for man when his lord tests him by honoring him and favoring him he says my lord has honored me
8916 but when he tests him by restricting his provision he says my lord has humiliated me
8917 no but you show no good to the orphan
8918 nor do you urge one another to feed the needy
8919 and you devour the inheritance with greed
8920 and you ardently love wealth
8921 no but when the earth quakes and is pounded
8922 and your lord comes with the angels rank upon rank
8923 and gehenna hell is brought near on that day the human will remember and how shall the reminder be for him
8924 he will say would that i had forwarded good works for my life
8925 but on that day none will punish as he allah will punish
8926 nor will any bind as he binds
8927 o satisfied soul
8928 return to your lord wellpleased wellpleasing
8929 join my worshipers and
8930 enter my paradise
901 no i swear by this country mecca
902 and you are a lodger in this country
903 and by the giver of birth and whom he fathered
904 we created the human in fatigue
905 does he think that none has power over him
906 he will say i have destroyed a vast wealth
907 does he think that none has observed him
908 have we not given him two eyes
909 a tongue and two lips
9010 and guided him on the two paths of good and evil
9011 yet he has not scaled the height
9012 what could let you know what the height is
9013 it is the freeing of a slave
9014 the giving of food upon the day of hunger
9015 to an orphaned relative
9016 or to a needy person in distress
9017 so that he becomes one of those who believe charge each other to be patient and charge each other to be merciful
9018 those are the companions of the right
9019 but those who disbelieve in our verses they are the companions of the left
9020 with the fire closed above them
911 by the sun and its midmorning
912 by the moon which follows it
913 by the day when it displays it
914 by the night when it envelops it
915 by the heaven and who built it
916 by the earth and who spread it
917 by the soul and who shaped it
918 and inspired it with its sin and its piety
919 prosperous is he who purified it
9110 and failed is he who buried it
9111 thamood belied in their pride
9112 when the most wicked of them broke forth
9113 the messenger of allah said to them this is the shecamel of allah let her drink
9114 but they belied him and hamstrung her so their lord crushed them for their sin and leveled it their village
9115 he does not fear the result of their destruction
921 by the night when it envelops
922 and by the day when it unveils
923 and by who created the male and female
924 your striving is indeed to different ends
925 for him that gives and fears allah
926 and believes in the finest
927 we shall surely ease him to the path of easing
928 but for him that is a miser and sufficed
929 and he belied the finest
9210 we shall surely ease for him the path of hardship the fire
9211 when he falls into hell his wealth will not help him
9212 indeed guidance is ours
9213 and to us belong the last and the first
9214 i have now warned you of the blazing fire
9215 in which none shall be roasted except the most wretched sinner
9216 who belied and turned away
9217 and from which the cautious shall be distanced
9218 he who gives his wealth to be purified
9219 and confers no favor upon anyone for recompense
9220 seeking only the face of his lord the most high
9221 surely he shall be satisfied
931 by the midmorning
932 and by the night when it covers
933 your lord has not forsaken you prophet muhammad nor does he hate you
934 the last shall be better for you than the first
935 your lord will give you and you will be satisfied
936 did he not find you an orphan and give you shelter
937 did he not find you a wanderer so he guided you
938 did he not find you poor and suffice you
939 do not oppress the orphan
9310 nor drive away the one who asks
9311 but tell of the favors of your lord
941 have we not expanded your chest for you prophet muhammad
942 and relieved you of your burden
943 that weighed down your back
944 have we not raised your remembrance
945 indeed hardship is followed by ease
946 indeed hardship is followed by ease
947 so when you have finished your prayer labor in supplication
948 and let your longing be for your lord in humility
951 by the fig and the olive
952 and the mount sinai
953 and this safe country mecca
954 indeed we created the human with the fairest stature
955 and we shall return him to the lowest of the low
956 except the believers who do good works for theirs shall be an unfailing recompense
957 so what then shall belie you concerning the recompense
958 is allah not the most just of judges
961 read prophet muhammad in the name of your lord who created
962 created the human from a blood clot
963 read your lord is the most generous
964 who taught by the pen
965 taught the human what he did not know
966 indeed surely the human is very insolent
967 that he sees himself sufficed
968 indeed to your lord is the returning
969 what do you think have you seen he who forbids
9610 a worshiper when he prays
9611 have you seen if he was upon guidance
9612 or orders piety
9613 what do you think have you seen if he belies and turns away
9614 does he not know that allah sees
9615 indeed if he does not desist we will seize him by the forelock
9616 a lying sinful forelock
9617 so let him call upon his way
9618 we will call the zabania the harsh angels of hell
9619 no indeed do not obey him prostrate and come nearer to allah
971 we sent this the holy koran down on the night of honor
972 what could let you know what the night of honor is
973 the night of honor is better than a thousand months
974 in it the angels and the spirit gabriel descend by the permission of their lord upon every command
975 peace it is till the break of dawn
981 the unbelievers among the people of the book and the idolaters would never desist until the clear proof came to them
982 a messenger from allah reciting purified pages
983 in which there are valuable books
984 those to whom the book was given did not divide themselves until the clear proof came to them
985 yet they were ordered to worship allah alone making the religion his sincerely upright and to establish their prayers and to pay the obligatory charity that is indeed the religion of straightness
986 the unbelievers among the people of the book and the idolaters shall be for ever in the fire of gehenna hell they are the worst of all creatures
987 but those who believe and do good deeds are the best of all creatures
988 their recompense is with their lord gardens of eden underneath which rivers flow where they shall live for ever allah is wellpleased with them and theyare wellpleased with him that is for he who fears his lord
991 when the earth is shaken with its mighty shaking
992 and when the earth brings forth its burdens
993 and the human asks what is the matter with it
994 on that day it shall proclaim its news
995 for your lord will have revealed to it
996 on that day mankind shall issue in scatterings to see their deeds
997 whosoever has done an atoms weight of good shall see it
998 and whosoever has done an atoms weight of evil shall see it
1001 by the snorting runners the horses
1002 by the strikers of fire
1003 by the dawnraiders
1004 raising a trail of dust
1005 dividing the gathering
1006 indeed the human is ungrateful to his lord
1007 to this he himself shall bear witness
1008 and indeed he is ardent for the love of good wealth becoming greedy
1009 does he not know that when that which is in the graves is overthrown
10010 and that which is in the chest is brought out
10011 indeed on that day their lord will be aware of them
1011 the clatterer the day of judgement
1012 what is the clatterer
1013 what shall let you know what the clatterer is
1014 on that day people shall become like scattered moths
1015 and the mountains like tufts of carded wool
1016 then he whose deeds weigh heavy in the scale
1017 shall live in a life which is pleasing
1018 but he whose weight is light in the scale
1019 his head will be in the plunging
10110 what shall let you know what the plunging is
10111 it is a fire which is extremely hot
1021 the excessive gathering of increase and boasting occupied you from worshipping and obeying
1022 until you visit the graves
1023 but no indeed you shall soon know
1024 again no indeed you shall soon know
1025 indeed did you know with certain knowledge
1026 that you shall surely see hell
1027 again you shall surely see it with the sight of certainty
1028 on that day you shall be questioned about the pleasures
1031 by the time of the afternoon
1032 surely the human is in a state of loss
1033 except those who believe and do good works and charge one another with the truth and charge one another with patience
1041 woe to every backbiter slanderer
1042 who amasses wealth and counts it
1043 thinking his wealth will render him immortal
1044 on the contrary he shall be flung to the crusher
1045 what shall let you know what the crusher is
1046 it is the kindled fire of allah
1047 which shall oversee the hearts
1048 closed around them
1049 in extended columns
1051 have you not seen how allah dealt with the companions of the elephant
1052 did he not cause their schemes to go astray
1053 and he sent against them flights of birds
1054 pelting them with stones of baked clay
1055 so that he made them like straw eaten by cattle
1061 for the custom of the koraysh
1062 their custom of the winter and summer journey
1063 therefore let them worship the lord of this house
1064 who fed them from hunger and secured them from fear
1071 have you seen he who belied the recompense
1072 it is he who turns away the orphan
1073 and does not urge others to feed the needy
1074 woe to those who pray
1075 who are heedless of their prayers delaying them from their prescribed times
1076 who show off
1077 and prevent the utensils of assistance
1081 indeed we have given you prophet muhammad the abundance al kawthar river its pool and springs
1082 so pray to your lord and sacrifice
1083 surely he who hates you he is the most severed
1091 say o unbelievers
1092 i do not worship what you worship
1093 nor do you worship what i worship
1094 nor am i worshiping what you have worshipped
1095 neither will you worship what i worship
1096 to you your religion and to me my religion
1101 when the victory of allah and the opening comes
1102 and you see people embracing the religion of allah in throngs
1103 exalt with the praise of your lord and ask forgiveness from him for indeed he is the turner for the penitent
1111 perish the hands of abilahab and perish he
1112 his wealth will not suffice him neither what he has gained
1113 he shall roast at a flaming fire
1114 and his wife laden with firewood
1115 shall have a rope of palmfiber around her neck
1121 say he is allah the one
1122 the called upon
1123 who has not given birth and has not been born
1124 and there is none equal to him
1131 say i take refuge with the lord of daybreak
1132 from the evil of what he has created
1133 from the evil of the darkness when it gathers
1134 from the evil of the blowers on knots
1135 from the evil of the envier when he envies
1141 say i take refuge with the lord of people
1142 the king of people
1143 the god of people
1144 from the evil of the slinking whisperer
1145 who whispers in the chests of people
1146 both jinn and people
