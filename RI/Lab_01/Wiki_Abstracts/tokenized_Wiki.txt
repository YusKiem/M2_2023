The Wankel engine is a type of internal combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion In contrast to the more common reciprocating piston designs the Wankel engine delivers advantages of simplicity smoothness compactness high revolutions per minute and a high powertoweight ratio primarily due to the fact that it produces three power pulses per rotor revolution compared to one per revolution in a twostroke piston engine and one per two revolutions in a fourstroke piston engine although at the actual output shaft there is only one power pulse per revolution since the output shaft spins three times as fast as the actual rotor does as can be seen in the animation below making it roughly equivalent to a 2stroke engine of the same displacement this is also why the displacement only measures one face of the rotor since only one face is working for each outut shaft revolution

Distributions or generalized functions are objects that generalize the classical notion of functions in mathematical analysis  Distributions make it possible to differentiate functions whose derivatives do not exist in the classical sense  In particular any locally integrable function has a distributional derivative  Distributions are widely used in the theory of partial differential equations where it may be easier to establish the existence of distributional solutions than classical solutions or appropriate classical solutions may not exist Distributions are also important in physics and engineering where many problems naturally lead to differential equations whose solutions or initial conditions are distributions such as the Dirac delta function which is a distribution not merely a function as its historical name might suggest
