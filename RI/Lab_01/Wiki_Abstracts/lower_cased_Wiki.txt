the wankel engine is a type of internal combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion in contrast to the more common reciprocating piston designs the wankel engine delivers advantages of simplicity smoothness compactness high revolutions per minute and a high powertoweight ratio primarily due to the fact that it produces three power pulses per rotor revolution compared to one per revolution in a twostroke piston engine and one per two revolutions in a fourstroke piston engine although at the actual output shaft there is only one power pulse per revolution since the output shaft spins three times as fast as the actual rotor does as can be seen in the animation below making it roughly equivalent to a 2stroke engine of the same displacement this is also why the displacement only measures one face of the rotor since only one face is working for each outut shaft revolution
